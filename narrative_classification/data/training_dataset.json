Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.\n\nAt his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.\n\nThey include non-strategic “battlefield” nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.\n\nThey have never been used in combat — so far.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nRussia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.\n\nThey include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.\n\nUnleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.\n\nBut he may not care about retaliation.\n\nThe Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.\n\nHe said: “If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.\n\n“Why do we need a world without Russia in it?”\n\nThis, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.\n\nSam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: “I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.”\n\nNato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.\n\nPavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: “One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.”\n\nAnd US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an “escalate to de-escalate” policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.\n\n'CONCERNING'\n\nMany wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.\n\nBut one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: “Putin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.”\n\nHowever, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: “It is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\n“Both the US and Russia have more than enough warheads to wipe each other out.\n\n“The concept of ‘mutually assured destruction’ still stands.”",

Coming Soon to Italy, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands\n\nEurope is thus being turned by the U.S. into the front line of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, even more dangerous than that of the Cold War.\n\n“Production of the B61-12 nuclear bomb begins,” Sandia National Laboratories announced from the United States. The B61-12, which replaces the previous B61 deployed by the U.S. at Aviano and Ghedi and other European bases, is a new type of weapon. It has a nuclear warhead with four power options, selectable depending on the target to be destroyed. It is not dropped vertically, but at a distance from the target on which it is directed guided by a satellite system. It can penetrate underground, exploding deep to destroy command center bunkers in a nuclear first strike.\n\nThe B61-12s, classified as “non-strategic nuclear weapons,” are deployed in Europe — in Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and probably other countries — at distances far enough to strike Russia. They thus have offensive capabilities similar to those of strategic weapons.\n\nAnother nuclear weapon system, which the United States is preparing to install in Europe against Russia, is ground-based intermediate-range missiles. They can also be launched from “anti-missile shield” installations, deployed by the U.S. at bases in Deveselu in Romania and Redzikowo in Poland, and aboard five warships cruising in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Baltic Sea close to Russia.\n\nThat such installations have offensive capabilities is confirmed by Lockheed Martin itself. Outlining the characteristics of the Mk 41 vertical launch system, used in both land and naval installations, it specifies that it is capable of launching “missiles for all missions, both defense and long-range attack, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.” These can be armed with nuclear warheads.\n\nEurope is thus being turned by the U.S. into the front line of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, even more dangerous than that of the Cold War.\n\nThis article was originally published on byoblu.

During the visit, the senior church leader held various interactions with faith leaders and community members. He also visited Jaranwala to express solidarity with the victims of the August 16, 2023, violent attacks on multiple churches and homes of Christians.\n\nSpeaking to a gathering of interfaith leaders at the Saint Peter’s High School of the Diocese of Raiwand, Archbishop Ernest noted the cordial relations between the clergy of the majority Muslim community and leaders of other faiths. He stressed on the need for continued engagement between the various faith groups for promoting harmony and peaceful coexistence in society.\n\n“It’s encouraging to see such good interfaith relations, which can also contribute greatly towards our common goal of protecting our environment,” said Archbishop Ernest.\n\nThe visiting dignitary was awarded a shield by Muslim faith leaders, including former special assistant to the prime minister on interfaith harmony Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi.\n\nThe archbishop also participated in a special meeting on climate action organised by the moderator bishop of the Church of Pakistan on Feb 4.\n\nAddressing the participants, Archbishop Ernest lauded the Church of Pakistan’s initiative on climate action, saying he was impressed by the realisation in the church for collaborating with ecumenical partners and faith-based institutions to bring about the much-needed change by raising awareness and collective action.\n\n“I think it’s a God given opportunity for us to be able to change the mentality of our people and to bring about the values of the Kingdom where respect for God’s creation and respect for the other are of crucial importance. Without respecting what God has given us so freely, it would be difficult for us to be instruments of grace in the world,” he said.\n\nEarlier, Bishop Marshall briefed the meeting about the church’s initiatives for fostering partnerships to meet the environmental challenges.\n\nHe stressed on inculcating the spirit of stewardship, as embodied by the wisdom of the Christian tradition, to change the mindset towards the natural world.\n\n“Though Pakistan is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, it is unfortunate that our country is also the least funded to effectively combat the crisis.\n\n“We need to act together to protect, restore and safeguard the environment for ourselves and for our future generations,” he emphasised.\n\nArchbishop Ernest and bishops of all dioceses of the Church of Pakistan also participated in the soft-launch of Bishop Marshall’s book titled “The Calling of Lent” at the Lahore College of Theology.\n\nThe messages of Archbishop of Canterbury Rt Revd Justin Welby and Anglican Communion’s Secretary General Rt Revd Bishop Anthony Poggo were also shared on the occasion.\n\nIn his message, Archbishop Welby said, “Archbishop Azad has taken considerable care to explore some of the spiritual disciplines which might help people journey more closely with Christ to the Cross and prepare for the celebrations of Easter.”\n\nBishop Poggo, who has written the foreword of the book, stated: “As you study this book during Lent, do please reflect upon the passion of Jesus. Lent is also a season whereby we acknowledge our need for repentance, mercy and forgiveness which is the essence of the message of Jesus Christ’s suffering on the cross.”",

Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There’s not one city that’s gotten better in the United States, and it’s visible,” Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.\n\n“Our economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians – a country most people can’t find out a map – who’ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don’t have enough tanks. I think it’s a fair question to ask, like, where’s the concern for the United States in that?” Carlson asks Pence.\n\nTo which Pence responds, “It’s not my concern. Tucker, I’ve heard that routine from you before, but that’s not my concern.”\n\nSeveral conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, “Tucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.”\n\nThe former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.\n\n“Sorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here’s the full clip of my remarks if you’re interested,” Pence wrote in his tweet.\n\nIn the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, “Anybody that says that we can’t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth. We can do both.\n\n“And as president of the United States, we will secure our border, we will support our military, we will revive our economy and stand by our values. And we will also lead the world for freedom under my administration. I promise you.”\n\nPence made an unannounced visit to Kyiv late last month and became the first declared 2024 Republican contender to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe 64-year-old made the trip with Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization that the former vice president previously accompanied to Poland and Ukraine, a Pence adviser said.\n\n“I really do believe that if Vladimir Putin and the Russian military were to overrun Ukraine, it wouldn’t be too long before they cross the border where our men and women would be required to fight,” Pence, an outspoken backer of the Ukrainian war effort and providing US military support for the country, told NBC News in June.",

This triggered devastating landslides and floods claiming at least 231 lives in Wayanad, the researchers said.\n\nAlso read | Wayanad landslides: PM Modi conducts aerial survey of disaster-hit areas, meets victims' families\n\n\"The rainfall that triggered the landslides occurred in a region of Wayanad that has the highest landslide risk in the state. Even heavier downpours are expected as the climate warms, which underscores the urgency to prepare for similar landslides in northern Kerala,\" said Maja Vahlberg, a climate risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe team of 24 scientists from India, the US, the UK, and Sweden examined climate models with high resolutions to reflect the rainfall activity in the Wayanad region for calculating the influence of humans on climate change.\n\nThe models suggest that climate change caused a 10 per cent increase in the intensity of the rainfall, they said. The models also forecast a further four per cent increase in the intensity of rainfall if there is a rise in the world's average temperature by two degrees Celsius.\n\nHowever, a \"high level of uncertainty\" revolves around the research model as the region of study is small and mountainous with complicated dynamics of rainfall and climate.\n\nAccording to scientists, events of this severity are likely to become more common in India and the rest of the world as the climate becomes warmer and warmer. In warmer temperatures air carries more moisture which leads to such heavy downpours in a single day.\n\nWayanad landslide was the third most intense in the state of Kerala since the Indian weather department started keeping records in 1901.\n",

Zelensky while there in Switzerland pressed Ukraine's case for the need to achieve air superiority.\n\nBut Putin in his fresh remarks stressed that not only do Russian forces have the clear upper hand, but he emphasized for the first time that Ukrainian statehood itself risks an \"irreparable\" blow if the war continues. He stressed that Ukraine's military has already \"failed\".\n\n\"Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces,\" Putin said in the televised remarks. \"If this continues, Ukraine's statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,\" he added, but he didn't clarify further precisely what he meant by this.\n\n\"They are trying to show that they can also do something. But instead of solving military tasks, they act in such a barbaric way. Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons,\" Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have killed and maimed Russian civilians.\n\nPutin further addressed Zelensky's efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland, to consider Kiev's 10-point peace plan, which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions.\n\n\"The so-called 'peace formula' that's being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia,\" Putin said, according to a translation in Sputnik.\n\n\"As for the negotiating process, it's an attempt to encourage us to abandon the territorial gains we've achieved over the past 1 1/2 years. But this is impossible. Everyone understands that this is impossible,\" the Russian leader continued.\n\nHe explained that earlier in the conflict, the two sides were close to serious negotiations that could have led to peace, but that ultimately Zelensky allowed himself to be the puppet of Western powers...\n\n\"A day later, they threw all the agreements into the trash, and now they are saying publicly—including the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group—that 'Yes, we were ready, but we missed the chance, because then-Prime Minister of Britain Mr. [Boris] Johnson came and persuaded us not to implement these agreements,'\" Putin said.\n\nHe stressed: \"Fools, are they not? They're admitting directly that if they had gone for it, everything could have been ended a long time ago, 1 1/2 years ago.\"\n\nLately, Ukraine has been seeking to get China involved in getting on board with its peace formula. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak on Sunday said, \"China needs to be involved in talks to end the war with Russia.\" He issued the words just ahead of the WEF. China remains the most influential Global South country widely viewed as squarely in Russia's corner, having refused to rebuke Moscow or join Western-led sanctions after two years of the conflict. Kiev hopes to get Global South countries on its side, thus further isolating Moscow - but so far this has proved somewhat futile.",

The startup examines solutions to decrease livestock emissions, with a focus on a dietary supplement for cattle with \"anti-methanogenic properties.\"\n\nRumin8's dietary supplement is synthesized from bromoform, an active ingredient in red seaweed, that prevents the creation of methane. The anti-methanogenic compounds in bromoform can target and eradicate bacteria producing the gas, reportedly cutting down on methane emissions and conserving animals' energy.\n\nAccording to the startup, early trials on cows fed with the supplement saw a more than 85 percent reduction in methane emissions. This amounts to two tons of greenhouse gases removed each year for every cow being fed. Identical technologies in other nations also indicate that feeding anti-methanogenic supplements could lead to cattle and sheep conserving more energy for food production.\n\nThe Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) developed a comparable version in 2022 that decreased methane production by up to 20 percent. The supplement also helped increase milk production in cows. ICAR used tannins and compounds found in legume plants for its dietary supplement.\n\nThe agricultural industry has been under fire for greenhouse gas emissions, specifically methane. According to a 2013 report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has 80 times the planet-warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years that it lingers in the atmosphere.\n\nThe globalist group also mentioned that methane accounts for around 30 percent of global warming that has happened since the Industrial Revolution. Agricultural methane released from livestock burps, farts and manure account for 32 percent of methane emissions.\n\nGates, who is a big fan of the latest technologies to fight climate change, has supported companies working on all types of solutions, including next-generation nuclear reactors and cutting-edge carbon capture designs. (Related: Why is Bill Gates buying up farmland across America?)\n\nAs reported in the statement, the recent funds will \"accelerate Rumin8's road to commercialization,\" as the firm plans out fresh international trials, branding projects and a pilot manufacturing plant.\n\n\"The demand for sustainable protein has never been more apparent, which is why BEV is keenly interested in reducing methane emissions from beef and dairy,\" Carmichael Roberts, co-lead at the corporation’s investment committee, said in the statement.\n\nGates' investment in Rumin8 signals his first Australian venture with Breakthrough Energy, but it is far from his first investment in climate tech-startups.\n\n\"We’re invested now in over 100 startups. This one here in Australia, Rumin8, I think it's the 103rd,\" Gates said during a recent interview in Sydney with Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, an independent think tank. The billionaire added that around six percent of global planet-warming emissions come from cows.\n\n\"It’s great to have Australia engaged in climate. The world isn't going to trade with people who don't have serious climate commitments. Australia was a bit of an outlier until quite recently.\"\n\nWatch this video of Bill Gates explaining why cows need to be changed, given that they account for six percent of global emissions.\n\nThis video is from the Thrivetime Show channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nVideo shows Bill Gates admitting \"clean energy\" solving climate change is a SCAM.\n\nMost scientists agree that changing climate conditions have nothing to do with human activity.\n\nBill Gates flies around Australia for climate change lectures in $70m private jet that guzzles fossil fuels.\n\nSources include:",

Over 60 delegates from nine U.S. states and Nova Scotia, Canada, are touring Finland to gain insights into the country's advanced forestry practices and innovative wood-based technologies.\n\nFor five days, the delegates will visit various Finnish industrial plants, research institutions, and universities.\n\nThey will explore forestry management, wood construction, and logging practices across southern, central, western, and eastern Finland. The aim is to familiarize the North Americans with Finland's forest expertise, sustainable forest policies, carbon reduction strategies, and the diverse operations of the Finnish forest industry.\n\nUlla Lainio, Senior Advisor at Business Finland Washington D.C., stated, \"The large group is touring industrial and forest sites to share knowledge about forestry, forest management, wood building, and logging. This visit reflects the significant interest in Finland's forest innovations.\"\n\nThe delegates are particularly interested in Finland's manufacturers of forest machines and wood construction equipment, as well as new bio-products such as wood-textile fibers, wood-based building materials, and biofuels. The goal is to foster collaboration in smart forestry, forest health, wood construction, and biomass sectors.\n\nThe U.S. forest industry has traditionally been underutilized due to cheap fossil energy and abundant hydropower. However, with the Biden administration's renewed focus on combating climate change, there is a growing interest in biofuels, biomass utilization, forest fire prevention, and advanced forest management technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act provides grants and tax incentives for the forestry sector, making this an opportune time for international collaboration.\n\nWooden house building is common in North America, with a high demand for suppliers of wood construction equipment, prefabricated house solutions, and CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) and LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) production lines. The delegation aims to find efficient construction solutions to address housing shortages and achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nFinland, along with Sweden, is a global leader in the forest bioeconomy. The North American delegation seeks partners in both industry and research to support the renewal and diversification of the forestry sector.\n\nOuti Suomi, Circular Transition for Zero Waste Mission Lead at Business Finland, emphasized, \"The forest policy is now favorable for reforms, and there is unprecedented interest towards Finland. The collaboration and mutual business opportunities for Finland's and North America's forest industries are significant.\"\n\nDuring their stay, the delegation will visit notable companies and research institutions, including Koskisen, Veisto, VTT, Pinomatic, UPM, Stora Enso, Metsä Group, Ponsse, University of Eastern Finland, John Deere, Business Joensuu, Natural Resources Institute Finland, Kira Hub, and Aalto University. They will also meet with over 25 forest sector companies showcasing innovative wood-based products, advanced wood construction techniques, and forest fire prevention solutions.\n\nThe delegation includes top officials responsible for forest use from Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, Colorado, Arkansas, California, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and Nova Scotia, as well as representatives from leading research universities, sawmills, major forestry companies, forest owners, logging companies, wood architecture firms, and investors.\n\nThis historic visit is expected to pave the way for significant collaborations and advancements in the global forest industry, highlighting Finland's pivotal role in sustainable forestry and wood innovation.\n\nHT",

The administration, for example, wants half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 to be zero-emission, despite sputtering EV sales.\n\nAll 8 of the states and D.C. have adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and will have an outright ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles after 2035.\n\nCalifornia was the first to adopt the rule, aiming to have 35% of new vehicle sales emit zero emissions by 2026, and boosting that goal to 68% by 2030.\n\nAccording to the California Air Resources Board, the regulation overhauls the state’s “growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100% zero-emission vehicles.”\n\nAs noted by Money, the states’ plans to ban gas-powered vehicles have generally not required votes from lawmakers, but have been advanced with support from governors and environmental regulators.\n\nThe EV market has struggled in recent months, as highlighted by The Daily Wire. Ford, for example, had to cut 1,400 employees from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, rolled back the planned production number of the electric F-150 Lightnings in half, and slashed $12 billion in EV investments.\n\nPresident Biden, however, is not slowing down when it comes to targeting the gas-powered vehicle industry. Earlier this month, Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set new eye-popping regulations in an effort to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road.\n\n\nThe new EPA rules set emission standards for vehicles made between 2027 and 2032 and would eliminate more than 7 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, setting off concerns across the nation.\n\nFor example, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) railed against the EPA’s move, calling it both “reckless” and “ill-informed.”\n\n“The federal government has no authority and no right to mandate what type of car or truck Americans can purchase for their everyday lives,” the senator said. “This reckless and ill-informed rule will impose what is effectively an EV mandate without ensuring the security of our supply chains from nations like China and without a realistic transition plan that addresses our domestic infrastructure needs.”",

The two Eastern European countries are also big exporters of coal and these metals.\n\nAt the same time, Indonesia is a big importer of crude oil and certain food commodities, such as wheat and soybeans. The two Eastern European countries are also big on some of these commodities.\n\n“This is the consequence of becoming a net exporter of commodities. Despite the hike in oil prices, we are still gaining amid the ongoing crisis in Eastern Europe,” said David Sumual, chief economist at Bank Central Asia (BCA), Indonesia's largest private lender, on March 11.\n\nGlobal commodity prices have been rising this year as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the price spike has been exacerbated by the war raging in Eastern Europe. Prices of nickel, coal and aluminum, as well as agricultural commodities like wheat, have surged to multiyear highs, with some hitting all-time peaks.\n\nRead also: High oil prices put new strains on state budget\n\nCoal prices passed US$439 per ton on March 8, a fivefold increase from last year, according to Business Insider data.

Twenty-seven children were among the injured.\n\nSpecialist doctors were being flown in from other parts of Russia.\n\nRussia will respond to Sunday’s attack, the Defense Ministry said, without elaborating. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been “in constant contact with the military” since the attack.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, described the incident as “a vile, despicable act against our people.”\n\nHe likened it to attacks carried out by gunmen on Sunday against a synagogue, a church, and police post in Dagestan and said there was “no difference to us” between the U.S. administration, Ukrainian leaders, and “crazy fanatics.”\n\nRussian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill said there “was no justification whatsoever for a missile strike on civilians” and expressed indignation that the incident occurred on the Orthodox holiday of Trinity.\n\nNeither Ukraine nor the United States has commented on the attack, which came on a day when Ukraine said one person had been killed and 10 others wounded by Russian strikes on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.",

[emphasis, links added]\n\nAmong the groups propped up by the administration is Climate Defiance, a radical environmentalist group comprised of young Marxists who regularly disrupt traffic and shout down U.S. politicians to coerce them into advancing their radical agenda.\n\nAccording to InfluenceWatch, much of the organization’s funding comes from the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF), a nonprofit “that channels money to groups engaged in climate activism.”\n\nCEF has previously received funding from “former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Onward Together, liberal activist Abigail Disney, and oil heiress Aileen Getty’s Aileen Getty Foundation.”\n\nIn its Saturday release, the White House specifically highlighted Climate Defiance’s Jan. 26 tweet celebrating the administration’s “monumental” decision to ax the aforementioned LNG projects.\n\n“Never thought we would see the day. The White House is amplifying our Twitter account. Words fail. Words fail. Words utterly fail,” Climate Defiance’s X account posted on Sunday.\n\nNever thought we would see the day. The White House is amplifying our Twitter account. Words fail. Words fail. Words utterly fail. pic.twitter.com/G6hFNLofGZ\n\n— Climate Defiance (@ClimateDefiance) January 28, 2024\n\nBeyond funding from Democrat-aligned entities, Climate Defiance is more well-known for its goal of “making life MISERABLE for every person in power” who opts not to endorse its extreme agenda.\n\nEarlier this month, for example, several of the group’s members “swarmed” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., while he was speaking at a New Hampshire diner.\n\nClimate Defiance agitators chanted “anti-fossil fuels slogans” during Manchin’s remarks. One of them, carrying a sign “calling for the end of fossil fuel dependence,” reportedly jumped in front of the senator’s SUV as it was departing the venue.\n\nThe group claimed Manchin uses his position as chair of the Senate Energy Committee to “protect his personal coal company.”\n\nClimate Defiance’s radical behavior doesn’t stop there.\n\nSince its 2023 launch, the group has attempted to corner several high-ranking Democrats, including President Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to InfluenceWatch, on April 29, its members “created a blockade to prevent elected officials from attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner at the Washington Hilton, hoping to see [the president] and demand an end to leasing public lands for fossil fuel projects.”\n\nThe organization’s members harassed Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., at a book launch event in May and “blocked traffic and protested outside” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s New York City residence later that same month.\n\nClimate Defiance demonstrators were also reportedly removed from a June event hosted by the Detroit Free Press, at which Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was scheduled to speak.\n\nAmong the phrases shouted by agitators were, “No MVP. No LNG. Granholm, you are killing me,” and, “F-ck you, Jennifer. F-ck you, Joe Biden. F-ck all these politicians.”\n\n",

Farming uses nitrogen, and suddenly, nitrogen is the new antagonist in the tale of global warming. The narrative is simple: eliminate nitrogen, and save the world. Yet, in the name of “preservation,” entire segments of our food production are under siege.\n\nConsider rice – a staple for half the world’s population. Renowned agencies claim, “Rice accounts for roughly 10% of global methane emissions,” emphasising the urgent need to curtail its production. But the ramifications? Starvation for billions.\n\nLook to the Netherlands for further evidence. Dutch farmers, the backbone of a nation that is a leading exporter of meat and agricultural products, are being chased off their lands. A staggering number, 3,000 farms, are forecasted to be confiscated in the coming years. The tragic fallout is evident, with a reported 20 to 30 farmers tragically ending their lives annually.\n\nOur friends in Europe are no strangers to these baffling decisions either. The European Commission greenlit a strategy to compensate livestock farmers for halting their operations in certain areas – with a stipulation that they never resume their animal breeding activities. The implications are clear: a drop in global food availability and an inevitable spike in prices.\n\nRemember Sri Lanka’s ill-fated venture into 100% organic farming?

However, service to others is but one way of honouring the whole of creation, which after all is a manifestation of the divine.

During my lifetime I’ve been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home we all share.”\n\nWhat has that message got to do with the birth of Jesus and Jesus’ message for the world? Is he conflating religions? Is he attempting to dilute or usurp the “Our Saviour is born” message?

Crucially, we are told, “it’s down to where the jet stream is”.\n\nIn an appeal to authority, without identifying any specific sources, Esme Stallard, climate and science reporter, with the assistance of all-purpose hack Sean Seddon, tell us that “meteorologists say” the wet and cool weather is due to the position of the jet stream, a core of strong winds sitting about five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface, and which dictate much of the UK’s weather.\n\nThe jet stream, we are then told, marks the boundary of cold air to the north in the polar regions and hot air to the south, a contrast which produces pressure differences. And last year, the jet stream was positioned further north, so the UK saw warm and dry weather created by the high-pressure system sitting over the country.\n\nAccording to these BBC sages, what is different about this month is that the jet stream has been stuck to the south of the UK, meaning its low-pressure system has been bringing cold and wet weather.\n\nThis is actually a pretty poor explanation of the meridional flow pattern which has been dominating the weather for a couple of years now, but that is of less concern than the need to tie in the phenomenon with global warming.\n\nAnd here, the formula used is classic is its dishonesty. “Some scientists think”, we are told, as if that is sufficient authority for what comes next. These wondrously anonymous “scientists” apparently think that higher temperatures due to climate change in the Arctic are causing the jet stream to slow, increasing the likelihood of high pressure and hot weather remaining in place. But that’s it – that’s all we get, followed by the assertion that “global warming means hot temperatures and wetter periods will become more typical for the UK”.\n\nRead more: Media weather anomalies and the propagandist BBC",

These vile virtue-signalers are hellbent on “saving the planet” while they force more Canadians into bankruptcy.\n\nNot that Liberal members of Parliament are fretting over this fiscal kick to the crotch, mind you. Because on that very same day the carbon tax increased, MPs benefited from a 4% pay raise. Must be nice. But if this is some sort of April Fools’ Day joke, we’re still searching for the punchline.\n\nProtests regarding the carbon tax increase erupted across our great dominion last Monday, including one in Uxbridge, Ont., where dozens of farmers assembled outside an arena. Can you blame them? The Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO) estimate that by 2030, Ontario grain and oilseed farmers alone will pay a staggering $2.7 billion in carbon taxes.\n\nRebel News journalist David Menzies (@TheMenzoid) reports from Uxbridge, Ont. as farmers take to the streets in opposition to the Trudeau Liberals' carbon tax increase.— Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) April 4, 2024\n\nOne of the farmers demonstrating in Uxbridge was Ted Eng, 71. He lamented that too many farmers are in a money-losing position now thanks to rising costs and labour rates. And increasing the tax threshold is akin to tossing gasoline on a bonfire.\n\nTed noted that if he were to sell his farm today, it would likely go for about $4 million. He’d be able to pocket the windfall and comfortably retire. But he doesn’t want to. He loves the land. He loves farming. He believes he’s going to die on his farm.\n\nCanadians should be grateful that there are farmers like Ted Eng. Their efforts produce the food that ends up in supermarkets. If farmers are taxed out of existence, then goodbye food security as our meat and potatoes would have to be imported from other nations that have governments that are more farm friendly.\n\nCheck out our interview with Ted Eng, who has much to say about the sorry state of farming these days… not that the Trudeau Liberals give a rodent’s rectum.\n\n",

        "content": "A Tesla Owner Just Exposed A Sick Secret About Electric Cars… \n\n A Tesla Owner Just Exposed A Sick Secret About Electric Cars…\n\nThe left has been preaching global warming, cooling, climate change, and end-of-the-world nonsense since before many of us were born.\n\nIn his book An Inconvenient Truth: The Crisis of Global Warming, Al Gore attempted to persuade everyone that the globe was overheating.\n\nDemocrats are always negotiating deals that place the United States at a competitive disadvantage with other countries, some of whom are our foes, such as Communist China.\n\nThey manipulate children into doing their bidding by convincing them that they only have a few years to live.\n\nFor them, it’s a pretty decent racket. However, there is another viewpoint.\n\nEconomic observers have long known that there are no free lunches, and perhaps it’s time that electric-car fans did as well.\n\nLeftists extol Teslas and other electric cars as cure-alls for fossil fuels’ woes – even when it comes to something as simple as their tires – but disregard the tremendous environmental damage these vehicles cause.\n\nBrad Templeton, a Forbes contributor, related a story of his electric car tearing through pricey tires at breakneck speed.\n\nDespite praising the many advantages of electric vehicles over traditional internal combustion engines, Templeton admitted that the requirement for tire replacement at short intervals is an inconvenient downside.\n\n“The doozy was needing new tires at around 28,000 miles,” Temple writes in “Electric Vehicle Maintenance Is Super-Cheap, But The Dark Secret Is Tires” from last month.\n\n“That was too early, far before their rated life.”\n\n“One reason for this was a stupid mistake on my part. In the past, I’ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.”\n\nElectric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.\n\nLike Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.\n\nNonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles – fewer environmental impacts for a higher price – is having the opposite effect.\n\nRegular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.\n\nGiven that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.\n\nSomehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green”? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls\n\n— Patrick De Haan ⛽️📊 (@GasBuddyGuy) November 11, 2021\n\nMicroplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n“Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green?” Author Patrick De Haan wrote of the deadly bargain greenies have made with batteries made from land-scarred processes.\n\nWhile proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and environmental costs are rising faster than ever before.\n",

He does this without end for Zelensky while actual Americans struggle to survive amid skyrocketing inflation and a collapsing economy.\n\n\"One-hundred percent not enough is being done, so people are doing it themselves,\" said Maui local Allisen Medina.\n\n\"The government, relief organizations – they're not doing anything. We have the right to know what's going on. FEMA came here to help with the recovery [process], but we don't see them. The Red Cross arrived four days late and they're not doing anything. They're supposed to help and not just stand around.\"\n\n\"We're only 100 miles from Oahu which has several military bases. Why is the response so lacking? Why are they doing so little? Why is nothing else being done?\"\n\nMedina's claims were corroborated by Southwest Airlines stewardess Sarah Trost, who says she spoke with a morgue worker in the Maui area who confirmed to her that the true death count so far is at least 480 people.\n\nAuthorities, Trost says, have only searched about 13 percent of the burnt-out area, not 78 percent like they recently falsely claimed.\n\n\"He found so many children, children and moms holding each other,\" Trost said in a video she posted to TikTok. \"Infants, toddlers, the unimaginable. Husbands and wives, whole entire [families] in a room just huddling together, burning to death.\"\n\nThere are also about 1,400 people still missing, whom some believe are dead and gone in the ashes – meaning they are unidentifiable.\n\n\"It's all bones,\" Trost said. \"So, he's grabbing the bones with the ash shoveling them into body bags. They have no more room on the island in the morgue so they're shipping in containers to hold those body bags.\"\n\nIn the comments, someone wrote that he suspects the true number of dead is more like 4,800, seeing as how the population of Lahaina before the fires was around 12,216 (as of 2020).\n\nThere does not appear to be anything natural about the Maui fires.

By subscribing you agree to our Terms of Use\n\n\nAccording to a WEF report, white people are responsible for the vast majority of the world’s problems including climate change and colonialism, and in the interests of an equitable future for the globe, the number of white people must be reduced as a priority.\n\nThe WEF has enlisted the United Nations to help with the plan and the results are already playing out before our eyes.\n\nBefore we dive in, subscribe to the channel if you haven’t already, and join the People’s Voice Locals community to join our incredible community and support the channel.\n\nThe Netherlands has become one of the global elite’s testing grounds for the most extreme policies.\n\nJust as the Netherlands was ground zero for the elite’s war on farmers, Dutch cities are also operating as laboratories for the elite’s plans to depopulate the world and radically alter demographics.\n\nEva Vlaardingerbroek reports from the Netherlands.\n\nWhat is wrong with our leaders?\n\nThey are fully bought and paid for compromised reprobates who have hitched their wagon to the globalist agenda and take their orders directly from Davos.\n\nCatching the elite in “mask off” moments is nothing short of terrifying.\n\nTake for example footage of a top CDC official saying that the elites must “get rid of of all the whites in the United States” and replace them with immigrants to create a more compliant society.\n\nDr. Carol Baker was describing what she described as the “solution” at a panel discussion in New York City.\n\nYou won’t be surprised to hear that Baker was appointed Chair of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization by Barack Obama’s Health and Human Services Secretary in 2009.\n\nShe was also honored with the 2019 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal at a D.C. ceremony sponsored by Pfizer and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIs anyone surprised that a Bill Gates-connected CDC official is openly suggesting depopulating America of white people who don’t cooperate with the elite’s vaccine agenda?\n\nThis is the same Bill Gates who told world leaders that it’s time to talk about “death panels” that will sentence ordinary, law-abiding people to death for the crime of being of no use to the elite.\n\nThis is the psychopathic world Bill Gates and his associates at the WEF are determined to usher in as part of their Great Reset and Great Replacement.\n\nIt gets even worse when you understand how far and wide their evil ideology has spread.\n\nThe globalist elite are no longer hiding their plans to depopulate the world by reducing the number of white people. This is a multi-pronged attack and we are now seeing what it looks like in real time.\n\nOf course, the mainstream media are still operating under instructions from the elite to attack anybody who dares to express what they can see with their own two eyes.\n\nThey will attack you, shout you down, and pressure your employer to fire you. You might lose your bank account.\n\nYou are simply not allowed to talk about the human tragedy of Biden and Harris’ open border, even though Biden is on record laying out his great replacement vision in 2015 in plain English for everybody to understand.\n\nBiden is a compromised puppet politician who has been shamelessly selling out America to the globalists for decades.\n\nNow that he has been sacrificed by the global elite in favor of Kamala Harris and appears to have been replaced by a body double who is approximately eight inches taller than the last version, it is worth pointing out that the elite think we are incredibly stupid.\n\nThey really think we are not paying attention to the mountains of evidence proving the multi-pronged attacks maiming and killing the population all have one thing in common.\n\nChemtrails and mRNA disproportionately target white people in a way that is statistically impossible unless it’s by design.\n\nOf course the plot to depopulate the world has been planned out in detail. The Covid vaccines have long been exposed as a bioweapon designed to cull the herd and depopulate the world.\n\nBut it gets even worse, as Robert F. Kennedy explained in New York City. The bioweapon is targeted to take out white people and spare other races.\n\nWe can’t allow the evil logic of ethnic bioweapons to become the new normal.\n\nHere at the People’s Voice we are determined to expose the agenda of the globalist elite.

        "content": "Pentagon plans to serve LAB-GROWN MEAT to troops in the name of climate change \n\n The Washington Free Beacon reported that BioMADE, a public-private partnership that has received more than $500 million from the DoD, is responsible for the endeavor. BioMADE announced on its website on June 3 that it is looking for new ideas to reduce the CO2 emissions from food production and transport at military sites. These ideas include \"novel cell culture methods suitable for the production of cultivated meat or protein\" – essentially a euphemism for lab-grown fake meat.\n\nLab-grown meat is a new technology where animal muscle and fat tissues are grown from modified animal cells in special equipment. This process uses a mix of chemicals, pressure and temperature to create meat that resembles beef, chicken and pork. Though still in the experimental stage, lab-grown meat has sparked a debate about its efficiency and ethics of producing meat without killing animals. (Related: Lab-made chicken meat grown from CANCER CELLS receives FDA approval - Are you ready to eat TUMOR nuggets?)\n\nBut according to a 2023 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis, the carbon footprint of lab-grown beef might be worse than that of the product it seeks to replace. It zoomed in on the use of highly refined or purified growth media, which is used to help animal cells multiply. They wrote that lab-grown meat using purified media in its production has a global warming potential four to 25 times greater than the average compared to the real thing.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two California companies to sell cultured chicken to restaurants in 2023, some believe taxpayer money shouldn’t fund the lab-grown meat industry.\n\nJack Hubbard, executive director for the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW), was among the vocal critics of the plan. \"Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund the lab-grown meat sector,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Our troops deserve better than to be served lab-grown meat, produced in bioreactors with immortalized cells and chemicals. Unfortunately, this effort is being driven by an agenda that is political and anti-farmer. Our soldiers should never be used as guinea pigs.\"\n\nEven Ethan Lane, vice president for government affairs at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, has criticized the DoD research grant that bankrolled BioMADE.\n\n\"It is outrageous that the DoD is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to feed our heroes like lab rats,\" he said in a statement. \"This misguided research project is a giant slap in the face to everyone that has served our country. Our veterans and active-duty troops deserve so much better than this.\"\n\n\"U.S. cattle producers raise the highest-quality beef in the world, with the lowest carbon footprint – and American troops deserve to be served that same wholesome, natural meat and not ultra-processed, lab-grown protein that is cooked up in a chemical-filled bioreactor.\"\n\nWatch this video about BioMADE's lab-grown meat for U.S. soldiers.\n\nThis video is from the Daily Videos channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nFlorida bill BANNING lab-grown meat awaits Gov.

This could be a huge source of national security, economic vitality can build our industrial base in Florida.”\n\nDeSantis’ claim echoes Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy‘s, who last Thursday said God has blessed America with large natural gas resources, and the United States should use them to make two of the world’s largest countries and largest economies, China and India, “dependent on American natural gas.” He suggested doing so would “make us economically stronger but geopolitically the world safer,” while falsely claiming it would make the world “environmentally sound.”\n\nThe Florida governor bragged to Varney about Florida’s reduction in emissions, which happened, he admitted, through “market forces.”\n\n“We’ve actually had a huge reduction in emissions but it was done through innovation,” DeSantis said. “It was done through market forces, not command and control. So we’ll go about that in a much different direction than, than Joe Biden, I think ultimately, Biden’s policies and Bidenomics is really about making the average person poor and reducing their standard of living.

I’ve had enough and I’m sick and tired of this.”\n\nOn Friday, Newsom’s office posted on X “Big Oil has been lying to us – covering up the fact that they’ve long known how dangerous the fossil fuels they produce are for our planet. It has been decades of damage & deception. With @AGRobBonta , California is taking action to hold big polluters accountable.”\n\nThe “big polluters” referred to in the post include Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and ConocoPhillips, Reuters reported. The American Petroleum Institute is also among the defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges these companies had caused Californians billions of dollars in damages and its authors plan to create what they call an abatement fund to use for coverage of future damages, the Reuters report also noted.\n\nOn Sunday, Newsom called the damage already done “incalculable”.\n\nThe state of California has been at the forefront of the energy transition, sporting the highest fuel prices in the nation and also the biggest EV market. California is also a major electricity importer from other states and an oil importer, too.\n\nEarlier this year, Governor Newsom signed a bill for the ban of internal combustion engine vehicles from 2035 in California, following in the footsteps of the European Union and the UK, both with their own ICE car bans in the works.\n\nIn comments on the lawsuit, Chevron said “Climate change is a global problem that requires a coordinated international policy response, not piecemeal litigation for the benefit of lawyers and politicians.”\n\n“Its local courts have no constructive or constitutionally permissible role in crafting global energy policy,” a company spokesman also said, as quoted by Bloomberg.\n\n",

The complaints of delays in wheat procurement and the exploitation by flour mills that were offering rates lower than the government-mandated price have been heard and addressed by the state.\n\nThe government’s decision not only addresses the grievances of the farmers but also reflects its willingness to listen to the concerns of the citizens and adjust government strategies in a timely manner – something we have been governmentally lacking for quite some time now.\n\nThe PM directed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited to ensure the swift buying of wheat from these farmers. This is the epitome of how citizens can hold the government accountable, reforming the governance policies and driving a positive change in society.\n\nHowever, the issue of wheat prices is still an issue – one that may not exactly be in the hands of the state. Support prices set by the provincial governments vary, as can be seen in the case of Balochistan and Sindh. Their respective prices are not adjusted to the recent inflation and have been carried on from last year’s wheat prices.\n\nThis is further aggravating the concerns of the farmers who are facing a higher cost of production owing to the higher energy and fertilizer costs. Not only does this make it challenging for the farmers to receive fair compensation for their produce, but it also does not take into account the impact of global warming that has further worsened their troubles. Heavier showers this year have adversely affected the harvesting season and crop yields for these farmers, and this needs to be accounted for.\n\nThe government’s efforts to address their concerns are a good step, but we need to extend more support to them in these difficult times. If we want to be more proactive in our governance, then considering the long-term implications of climate change on our agriculture will be wise moving forward.\n\nUnpredictable weather patterns and extreme precipitation disproportionately affect our farmers, jeopardizing their sole source of income. As such, the state must stand by vulnerable farming communities and formulate policies to mitigate the impact, ensuring sustainable agricultural development in the nation.",

I suggest we learn from the source.”\n\nAsked whether the draft treaty could serve as a basis for further peace talks, Peskov said Kiev’s public position was to reject talks with Russia. The idea of reviving the failed agreement was floated by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko when he met Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin earlier this month.\n\nJohnson has denied derailing the peace talks, but has also bragged on multiple occasions about his policy of nudging Kiev into continuing hostilities with Russia, which the British politician claims to be a fight for global democracy.\n\n“There could be no more effective way of investing in Western security than investing in Ukraine, because those guys without a single pair of American boots on the ground are fighting for the West,” Johnson told students at Georgetown University during a visit to the US this month. The Ukrainians “are effectively fighting our own fight, fighting for our own interests,” he added.\n\nRussian officials have described the Ukraine conflict as a Western proxy war against Moscow, which the US and its allies allegedly intend to wage “to the last Ukrainian.” Their goal, according to Moscow, is to contain Russia and stall its development, rather than protect the interests of the Ukrainian people.",

        "content": "How Do Animals React During a Total Solar Eclipse? \n\n When a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic? Will giraffes gallop? Will apes sing odd notes?\n\nResearchers will be standing by to observe how animals’ routines at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas are disrupted when skies dim on April 8, The Associated Press reported. They previously detected other strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness.\n\n“To our astonishment, most of the animals did surprising things,” said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a North Carolina State University researcher who led the observations published in the journal Animals.\n\nWhile there are many individual sightings of critters behaving bizarrely during historic eclipses, only in recent years have scientists started to rigorously study the altered behaviors of wild, domestic and zoo animals.\n\nSeven years ago, Galapagos tortoises at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, “that generally do absolutely nothing all day ... during the peak of the eclipse, they all started breeding,” said Hartstone-Rose. The cause of the behavior is still unclear.\n\nA mated pair of Siamangs, gibbons that usually call to each other in the morning, sang unusual tunes during the afternoon eclipse. A few male giraffes began to gallop in “apparent anxiety.” The flamingos huddled around their juveniles.\n\nResearchers say that many animals display behaviors connected with an early dusk.\n\nIn April, Hartstone-Rose’s team plans to study similar species in Texas to see if the behaviors they witnessed before in South Carolina point to larger patterns.\n\nSeveral other zoos along the path are also inviting visitors to help track animals, including zoos in Little Rock, Arkansas; Toledo, Ohio; and Indianapolis.\n\nThis year’s full solar eclipse in North America crisscrosses a different route than in 2017 and occurs in a different season, giving researchers and citizen scientists opportunities to observe new habits.\n\n“It’s really high stakes. We have a really short period to observe them and we can’t repeat the experiment,\" said Jennifer Tsuruda, a University of Tennessee entomologist who observed honeybee colonies during the 2017 eclipse.\n\nThe honeybees that Tsuruda studied decreased foraging during the eclipse, as they usually would at night, except for those from the hungriest hives.\n\n“During a solar eclipse, there’s a conflict between their internal rhythms and external environment,” said University of Alberta's Olav Rueppell, adding that bees rely on polarized light from the sun to navigate.\n\nNate Bickford, an animal researcher at Oregon Institute of Technology, said that “solar eclipses actually mimic short, fast-moving storms,” when skies darken and many animals take shelter.\n\nAfter the 2017 eclipse, he analyzed data from tracking devices previously placed on wild species to study habitat use. Flying bald eagles change the speed and direction they’re moving during an eclipse, he said. So do feral horses, “probably taking cover, responding to the possibility of a storm out on the open plains.”\n\nThe last full US solar eclipse to span coast to coast happened in late summer, in August. The upcoming eclipse in April gives researchers an opportunity to ask new questions including about potential impacts on spring migration.\n\nMost songbird species migrate at night. “When there are night-like conditions during the eclipse, will birds think it’s time to migrate and take flight?” said Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University.\n\nHis team plans to test this by analyzing weather radar data – which also detects the presence of flying birds, bats and insects – to see if more birds take wing during the eclipse.\n\nAs for indoor pets, they may react as much to what their owners are doing – whether they’re excited or nonchalant about the eclipse – as to any changes in the sky, said University of Arkansas animal researcher Raffaela Lesch.\n\n“Dogs and cats pay a lot of attention to us, in addition to their internal clocks,” she said.\n\nWhen a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic? Will giraffes gallop? Will apes sing odd notes?",

Mike DeWine following the train derailment disaster in East Palestine that led to an unprecedented release of highly toxic chemicals, just days after the CDC edited the toxicology profile for vinyl chloride, massively increasing the lethal exposure level and removing information about how the chemical affects children\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Ohio’s state government that it was not eligible for disaster assistance to help the community recover from the toxic spill, Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for DeWine, told Fox News Digital on Thursday. Tierney explained that FEMA believed the incident didn’t qualify as a traditional disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, for which it usually provides assistance.\n\nAccording to Zelensky’s Ukrainian government, the US leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between January 24, 2022 through November 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.\n\nIt is clear where Biden’s loyalties lie and the people of Ohio do not figure in that equation.\n\nFox reports: In that same span, the rest of the world has contributed less than $75 billion of total aid, with most of that sum coming from the United Kingdom ($28.2 billion), Poland ($24.3 billion), and Estonia ($5.48 billion).\n\nSome members of Congress are looking to put a stop to the superabundant spending by the U.S. government, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who introduced a resolution to end military and financial aid to Ukraine.\n\n“How much more for Ukraine? Is there any limit?” asked Gaetz, R-Fla., on the House floor. “Which billionth dollar really kicks in the door? Which red line we set will we not later cross?”\n\nThe proposal also urges Ukraine and Russia to seek a peace deal, requiring them to renew their negotiations.",

This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.\n\nThe preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his “pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands”. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.\n\nTo be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.\n\nThe targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.\n\nIf the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.\n\nThe growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this. Attempting to discredit this trend as being due to Russian meddling is disrespectful to democracy.",

Doing this can help to cut contamination, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill use.\n\nThe Ljubljana Regional Waste Management Centre (RCERO Ljubljana) is the biggest environmental project in Slovenia, and the most modern facility for waste treatment in Europe.\n\nIt is also Slovenia’s biggest cohesion fund environmental project, and a great example of regional cooperation.\n\nEuronews’ Aurora Velez spoke with RCERO Ljubljana’s Founder and Head of Investments and Development, Mjtja Praznik, who created, designed and founded the centre from scratch.\n\nEuronews: How did you come up with the idea for the project?\n\nMjtja Praznik: Some of the activities started in 2000 when Slovenia was joining the EU: we had to adopt a lot of legislative changes in the field of waste management. Up to that time, most of the municipal waste was thrown into landfill. And this, according to new legislation, needed to stop.\n\nSo we thought we needed to treat waste: first, separate it, and then use it for material recycling and energy recovery.\n\nEuronews: What is - according to you- the impact of the project in Slovenia and in Europe?\n\nMjtja Praznik: Slovenia was treating its municipal waste mainly by landfill, losing all the materials and all the energy. By changing the principle, and by introducing this new treatment for waste, the rate of material being recycled has considerably improved.\n\nWe have also replaced some combustibles and energies from the fuel produced in the waste and, last but not least, we have also significantly reduced the amount of waste that is going into landfill. From the new plant, only 2% of the waste goes there: the other 98% is transformed into fuel!\n\nEuronews: How do you feel about having created the project from scratch?\n\nMjtja Praznik: I am very proud of this project. I had the idea 20 years ago and had started researching the technology then.\n\nI am happy that we were able to use our previous experience from landfill, gas extraction and utilisation. All this knowledge has been key to the project. We have aerobic treatment, anaerobic treatment, mechanical treatment: these are all my babies!\n\nI started with it, and I went through all these phases: preparing, studying, comparing different technologies. And lastly, opting for the finance from the European Commission, because the project was not cheap!\n\nThen it took around three and a half years to get the project ready for operation. I'm happy that it was a long project because it is a big one that can't be done overnight.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",

His message? Ukraine’s war with Russia and Putin is Europe’s fight, too.\n\nThe court is the legal arm of the Council of Europe, the continent’s foremost human rights body, which expelled Russia from its ranks more than two years ago after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The expulsion means that the court has no enforcement powers over Russia.\n\nHowever, the ruling could bolster cases filed by individuals seeking reparations.\n\nMoscow maintains that it rightfully took over Crimea after an overwhelming majority of local residents voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in a referendum. It has continuously rejected accusations of human rights violations in the region.\n\nUkraine and most Western governments, including the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany, condemned the annexation of Crimea as illegal, calling the referendum a sham.\n\nIn the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia, a Russia-style bill targeting civil society and independent media nears final enactment amid protests. Critics see a Kremlin hand.\n\nIn its written ruling, the court found Russia responsible for breaches including enforced disappearances and the abuse of Ukrainian soldiers, ethnic Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and journalists.\n\nIt also held Moscow responsible for discrimination including the harassment and intimidation of religious leaders, cracking down on non-Russian media, banning public gatherings and expressions of support for Ukraine, and suppressing the Ukrainian language in schools.\n\nThe decision Tuesday by the human rights court comes six months after the top United Nations court ruled that Moscow breached an international treaty on eradicating racial discrimination by limiting school education in Ukrainian and by maintaining a ban on a Tatar assembly called the Mejlis.",

Russia is supporting Nazi people who want to commit genocide on us and Russia will pay the price,” Weitmann said, according to Newsweek. “We’re gonna win this war. Afterwards, we’re not forgetting what you’re doing, we’re not forgetting, we will come, we will make sure Ukraine wins. We will make sure that you pay the price for what you have done, you as Russia.”\n\nThe host of the program said Moscow has been calling for a ceasefire and has been looking for a solution to the conflict in Israel.\n\n“I understand you’re on the Russian payroll, and I understand this is Russian propaganda. But you have to be very careful, because, let me tell you, we’re going to finish this war. We’re going to win because we’re stronger,” he said, according to The New Voice of Ukraine.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Putin once had a relatively close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but since the outbreak of the Ukraine War, there seems to be a chill. The paper noted that as of Friday, the Russian leader has not reached out to his Israeli counterpart.\n\nInstead, Putin—while condemning the Hamas attack—said the incident was a “clear example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East.” While making clear that he believes Israel has an obligation to defend itself, Washington’s knee-jerk reaction is to never take into account the “fundamental interests of the Palestinian people.”\n\nErdogan seemed to agree, saying: “If the West has the slightest respect for human rights, it must discuss the types of aid that should be sent to Gaza. There is no way to bring peace to the Middle East except through establishing a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.”\n",

        "content": "British Police Given New Powers to Crack Down on Disruptive Protests \n\n LONDON (AP) – New and expanded powers for British police took effect on Sunday, including measures targeting activists who stop traffic and major building works with protests.\n\nAuthorities have repeatedly condemned environmental protest groups, including Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, which have sought to raise awareness about the urgency of climate change by staging multiple high-profile protests at the busiest highways and roads. Their protests in recent years often caused serious disruption for motorists.\n\nFrom Sunday, police will have powers to move static protests. Critics have argued the toughened laws are a threat to the right to protest, but U.K. officials say the measures were to stop “disruption from a selfish minority.”\n\n“The public have had enough of their lives being disrupted by selfish protesters. The mayhem we’ve seen on our streets has been a scandal,” Home Secretary Suella Braverman said.\n\nAuthorities say that under the new Public Order Act, protesters found guilty of “tunnelling” – or digging underground tunnels to obstruct the building of new infrastructure works – could face three years in prison. Anyone found guilty of obstructing a major transportation project could be jailed for up to six months.\n\nThe law also makes “locking on,” or protesters attaching themselves to other people, objects or buildings, a criminal offense.\n\nHundreds of climate change protesters were arrested last year in the U.K. for blocking major roads and bridges. Many activists protested by sitting in the middle of the roads or gluing themselves to the roadway to make them harder to move.\n\nThe civil disobedience is a wave of direct action that has also seen activists glue themselves to famous museum paintings or throw soup at artworks to draw media attention to their cause.\n\nPolice have said it’s costly to deal with the protests and that they diverted thousands of officers from other work like dealing with crime.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",

        "content": "Climate Expert: ‘Three Strikes’ Against Climate Alarmism \n\n Facts and data show “three strikes and climate alarmism should be out,” climate truth-teller Steve Milloy told PJ Media. “But it’s still at bat and swinging,” propped up by the “fake news media.”\n\nJunk Science’s Milloy explained the three biggest truths undermining the mainstream narrative in exclusive comments to PJ Media. [emphasis, links added]\n\n“We are 35 years into climate alarmism, and we’ve had no global warming since 2015 despite 450 billion tons of emissions; no type of natural disaster correlates with emissions or warming; and no apocalyptic climate prediction has ever come true,” Milloy stated.\n\nIt’s time to admit the fraud.\n\n“That’s three strikes and climate alarmism should be out. But it’s still at bat and swinging because the fake news media shares its leftist agenda and will not call it out,” Milloy added.\n\nAfter all, governments can use climate change as a convenient excuse for increasing their power and control.\n\nMilloy’s comments followed the publication of a new report.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), The Heartland Institute, the Energy & Environmental (E&E) Legal Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the International Climate Science Coalition, and Truth in Energy and Climate issued their “Climate Fact Check: September 2023 Edition.” Milloy posted the report at ClimateRealism.com.\n\nThe first myth the groups attacked was the media apocalypse prophesying on “global warming.” They looked at data to determine if September did have record heat.\n\nBased on NASA satellite data, September 2023 had the highest temperature anomaly (i.e., difference from average) on record. It was 0.9C warmer than the 1991-2020 average.\n\nIn contrast, the Temperature.global compilation of actual temperature measurements from surface stations has September only slightly warmer than the average monthly temperature of the past 8 years and 9 months, and far from the warmest month since January 2015.\n\nWhich data is more accurate and reliable? “NASA admits the surface stations are. There has still been no global warming since January 2015,” the report insisted. [That’s “because they directly measure the temperature where people reside”]\n\nIt also stated that “average global temperature” is “not an actual physical metric,” but merely a “flawed notion” used to fuel climate alarmism.\n\nThe report analyzed and fact-checked multiple media claims about the past month’s weather. Did the huge downpour in New York City break records and was it due to climate change?\n\nNo, the groups said, citing the New York Times’s records to disprove the claims.\n\nAs The New York Times asserted, is rainfall across the country becoming “more fearsome” due to global warming? The problem with that claim is that warmer air doesn’t cause “more intense rainfall,” the groups explained.\n\nAre Alpine glaciers melting at a concerning rate? Perhaps, but it’s not because of man-made “emissions;” the report noted that the Alps were free of ice thousands of years ago, and the current receding has been ongoing for years, before modern industrial society.\n\nThe report further fact-checked claims around hurricanes, Antarctic ice, emissions and the “hottest summer” propaganda, Norwegian glaciers, and allegedly human-driven global warming.\n\nIt ends by providing context to an analysis supposedly proving man-driven global warming. If you add in the warming caused by “the series of El Niños,” it’s highly questionable that fossil fuels have warmed Earth “to any discernible extent.”\n\nIn fact, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data showed earlier this year that there hadn’t been global warming for eight years.\n\nThe “climate crisis” is an unscientific political crock.\n",

The former US Secretary of State, who is on the notorious Ukrainian “kill list”, addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, via video link. He said, “Before this war, I was opposed to the membership of Ukraine in NATO, because I feared it would start exactly the process that we have seen.” “Now, that this process has reached this level, the idea of a neutral Ukraine under these conditions is no longer meaningful,” he added. \n\nKissinger said he wanted to express admiration for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the “heroic conduct of the Ukrainian people”. However, in no time, he went on to propose the same peace deal that he had put forward at Davos in May last year during which the former US Secretary of State advocated an urgent end to hostilities in Ukraine, lest Russia is “driven into a permanent alliance with China.\" US should support Ukraine Kissinger argued that the US should continue to support and if required, intensify its military support for war-torn Ukraine until a ceasefire line is reached, or accepted, at preliminary talks with Russia. \n\nHe also said the peace talks should begin once Ukrainian forces had reclaimed the territories occupied by Russia since the invasion began on February 24, 2022. Kissinger’s way to prevent escalation of conflict Kissinger said the only way to prevent the conflict from escalating is to do “exactly” what Ukraine, the US and its allies have been doing till now: “demand a Russian withdrawal, while Ukraine military and financial aid and maintaining sanctions and other pressures” on Moscow. \n\nHe said that the destruction of Russia as a state that can pursue its own policies “will open up the vast area of its 11 time zones to internal conflict and to outside intervention at the time when there are 15,000 and more nuclear weapons on its territory.” “So this is why I believe in dialogue with Russia while the war continues, an end of fighting when the pre-war line is reached, and a continuing process of discussion by Europe, America and at that point Russia … while the conditions of sanctions and other pressures will be maintained until a final settlement is reached,” he added. Russia should be given ‘opening’ to rejoin the West Kissinger argued that Russia must be given an “opening” to rejoin the West, “if it meets the required conditions to participate as a member in these European processes\". \n\nHe further said that the move could be important to avoid the perception that the conflict has become “against Russia itself,” which may cause Russians to re-evaluate both their historic “attraction to the culture of Europe and a fear of domination by Europe.” Kissinger also said the military alliance led by the US ought to be the guarantor of the final peace settlement “in whatever forms NATO can develop.\" \n\nWho is Henry Kissinger? Aged 99, Kissinger was the US secretary of state between 1973-1977 under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He also served as the national security advisor between 1969 and 1975. He was a crucial part of the US detente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with China. Kissinger also played a pivotal role in the talks to end the Vietnam War. \n\nHenry Kissinger argued that the US should continue to support and if required, intensify its military support for war-torn Ukraine until a ceasefire line is reached, or accepted, at preliminary talks with Russia read more\n",

In the first image released by the experiment, which aims to study intense thunderstorms from a better vantage point as well as weather phenomena in high altitude, a Transient Luminous Event (TLE) is seen between 40 and 80 kilometers (25-50 miles) above the Earth.\n\nTLEs, sometimes called \"sprites\", \"red sprites\", or \"red jellyfish sprites\", have been reported by pilots for decades, but were only recorded for the first time in July 1989. They are rarely seen from the surface, which is probably for the best, given the illusion they create of an invading alien space force.\n\nLike regular lightning strikes, the sprites occur following a build-up of electrical charge within clouds. With red sprites, however, the discharge occurs into the Earth's mesosphere up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) above the Earth. The eerie red color occurs as the charge meets nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nMogensen captured the sprite with an \"event camera\", which according to ESA works more like a human eye than a regular camera, sensing changes in contrast rather than capturing an image. An advantage of these cameras is they can produce around 100,000 images a second, while drawing very little power to do so. Among other aims, the study strives to better understand how lightning in the upper atmosphere affects the concentration of greenhouse gases.\n\n“These images taken by Andreas are fantastic,\" Olivier Chanrion, lead scientist for this experiment, told ESA of this first image from it. \"The Davis camera works well and gives us the high temporal resolution necessary to capture the quick processes in the lightning.\"",

He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.\n\nOver the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow’s claims.\n\n“If you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,” Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.\n\nIn his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the ‘dirty bomb’ plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.\n\n“They can come, but I am telling you that a ‘dirty bomb’ is not a very complex device,”Polyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart.\n\nAt the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a ‘dirty bomb’ remains “very high,” and that Ukraine “has the opportunity” and “has every reason to use it.”\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission’s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a ‘dirty bomb’ by Ukraine “an act of nuclear terrorism.”\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations “as absurd as they are dangerous.” He also noted that “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to “prove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.”\n\n“Good cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia’s ‘dirty bomb’ disinfo campaign,” Kuleba said.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that “all parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what’s already a devastating conflict.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia’s allegations against Ukraine were “transparently false.” NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies “reject the allegation” and believe that Russia “must not use it as a pretext” for further escalation.\n\nSource: https://tapnewswire.com/2022/10/russia-exposure-of-dirty-bomb-plans-caused-panic-in-kiev/\n\nAnyone can join.\n\nAnyone can contribute.\n\nAnyone can become informed about their world.\n\n\"United We Stand\" Click Here To Create Your Personal Citizen Journalist Account Today, Be Sure To Invite Your Friends.\n\nHumic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex\n\nHerbAnomic’s Humic and Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex is a revolutionary new Humic and Fulvic Acid Complex designed to support your body at the cellular level.

Not so long ago, we completed the formation of our segment of the International Monitoring System. We are ready to return to the issue of its ratification as soon as the US does this,” he said.\n\nThe Russian foreign minister also accused the Western countries of “tailoring” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to their interests.\n\n“We are convinced that to prevent further degradation of the world situation, maintain durable stability and create realistic disarmament, all countries should pool their efforts to upgrade the international security system relying on the principles of multilateralism, equality and indivisibility. This is the only way of reducing interstate conflicts and ensuring real progress in arms control,” he said.",

        "content": "Climate Scam: Solar Manufacturer Earning up to $710M in Government Subsidies This Year \n\n The great Rush Limbaugh once said, “Climate change is not about climate change. It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government.” Well, a solar company in Arizona is receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies this year, the overwhelming majority of its operating profit. That’s right. Your tax dollars are working to prop up a toxic and unreliable energy source under the Biden administration.\n\nHere is the full quote from Rush Limbaugh:\n\nClimate change is not about climate change. It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government. It’s all about expanding the government and government control over people. It’s about creating victims. When you successfully turn somebody into a victim, you have automatically made them a dependent on you. You are essentially telling them they have lost the power necessary to solve their own problems. And you create within them a mentality that they can’t overcome their own problem because they’re victims.\n\nThis whole paragraph is absolutely true, but I’m going to focus on the first point made. Climate change certainly allows many young people to feel virtuous for engaging in destructive or pointless demonstrations while they claim that the problems in their lives are caused by some vaguely defined climate catastrophe, one which government has to fix for them. Most of all, however, the climate scam is a way of enriching its proponents in government and business.\n\nRelated: Climate Expert: Gas Car Cancellation Is Intended to End Private Transport\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported July 31 that Arizona-based solar panel manufacturer First Solar “expects to receive as much as $710 million this year—nearly 90% of forecast operating profit—from subsidies the U.S. government rolled out a year ago to encourage domestic renewables production.” WSJ added, “One analyst estimates the incentives could be worth more than $10 billion for the company over the next decade.” Talk about hitting the jackpot.\n\nFrom WSJ:\n\nFirst Solar expects to have as much as a 60% share of the U.S. market for large-scale solar installations this year, largely a result of government policies that are pushing clean-energy developers to buy more made-in-America components.\n\nThe company’s shares have more than doubled to $208.40 in Friday trade since the beginning of 2022, despite a string of earnings disappointments during that period.\n\nThe manufacturer has even announced a new factory.\n\nWhat is not being said here is that solar panels generate lots of toxic waste and are unreliable as an energy source. Also, solar panels have killed billions of birds. Meanwhile, huge swathes of natural scenery and farmland must be ruined to set up solar panels. Solar is also unprofitable when left to survive on its own merits; that’s why so many government subsidies are needed. Solar panels are a terrible choice, both for the environment and for the energy grid. They are not a solution to the fake climate crisis.\n\nAs the above Limbaugh quote noted, it’s a money-making scam.",

        "content": "Math Confirms Foolishness of Warming Alarm \n\n The science of climate change often is presented in complicated language that speaks of computer models and the theoretical inputs and outputs thereof and concludes that the globe is on the verge of “boiling.” Well, leave it to three physicists -- steeped in calculus and such arcane matters as the behavior of molecules and the nuclear charge of atoms -- to simplify the analysis and arrive at a much less alarming determination.\n\n“Straightforward calculations … show that eliminating U.S. CO2 emissions by the year 2050 would avoid a temperature increase of 0.0084 degrees Celsius,” states a brief paper authored by Drs. Richard Lindzen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; William Happer, Princeton University; and William A. van Wijngaarden, York University, Toronto. On the Fahrenheit scale, the value of averted warming is 0.015 ◦F degrees.\n\nIn short, the amount of warming averted by eliminating CO2 emissions in the United States would be too small to measure. The paper bolsters the position of those who argue that a changing climate is the product of natural forces, that human-induced carbon dioxide emissions can have only a minuscule effect on global temperature, and that CO2 is a valuable plant food and not a pollutant.\n\nRather than using theoretical assumptions about various factors that are fed into computers, the paper’s calculation relies almost exclusively on “observable data” that are widely accepted and publicly available, says Dr. Happer.\n\n“This is something anybody with a calculator can figure out,” said the scientist, who may be best known for his contribution to a laser-based technology for destroying incoming ballistic missiles as part of the so-called Star Wars program of the 1980s.\n\nThe data needed for the math are the number of years until 2050, the amount of carbon dioxide being added to the atmosphere, which scientists regularly measure, and the current concentration of atmospheric CO2, which is approximately 427 parts per million as of June 2024.\n\nThe only assumed datapoint is the sensitivity of the atmosphere to CO2 increases. The paper uses a value almost the same as one commonly used “before global-warming alarmism became fashionable.” Even if the value is quadrupled to a number favored by the politically driven Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the amount of warming averted still is only 0.034 degrees Celsius.\n\nSo, what if the entire world eliminated carbon dioxide emissions from the activities of mankind? Since U.S. emissions account for 12% of global output, the answer lies in the math to determine the remaining 88%. The paper’s calculation is that the amount of warming averted would be 0.07 degrees Celsius. Using the higher IPCC sensitivity value, the number quadruples to 0.28 degrees Celsius. Both are still inconsequential and certainly not worth destroying the world economy.\n\nNoting that others using different approaches have come to conclusions similar to the paper’s, Dr. Happer said he and his coauthors wanted to show that the controversial subject of climate change need not be complicated.\n\n“More members of the public should understand that they are being victimized by false information disseminated by those whose interests have more to do with money and power than with environmental concerns,” he said. “Answers found in relatively simple mathematics strongly suggest this to be the case.”\n\nWhatever the motivations, spending trillions of dollars to replace fossil fuels with expensive and unreliable wind and solar sources is foolish, futile and dangerous.",

Established in 2022, the Rumpin Nursery was inaugurated by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and is the result of a collaboration between the Environment and Forestry Ministry, the Public Works and Housing Ministry, and APRIL Group, a pulp and paper producer.\n\nAPRIL Group's nursery system in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau province, inspired the Rumpin Nursery development, which has the capacity of planting approximately 200 million new seedlings per year. The company continues to invest heavily in research and development to increase plantation fiber productivity.\n\nOver the next three years, the Indonesian government plans to build 30 nursery centers, each with an annual production capacity of 10 to 12 million seedlings, which will result in a combined annual production of 360 million seedlings. These seedlings will be used to rehabilitate and restore degraded lands, to be planted on critical land, areas with high landslide potential and upper reaches of river basins (DAS).\n\nThe Rumpin Nursery has successfully grown and planted thousands of native tree species, including Manglid, Sengon, Salam and Sirsak. Since President Jokowi's inauguration last year, the nursery has begun distributing seedlings in a number of locations such as the Ciliwung River. Following the Rumpin Nursery's successful collaboration, the government is currently focusing on developing additional nurseries in other regions, including Danau Toba, Likupang, Mentawir and Bali.\n\nBy replicating and scaling up such models, Indonesia can unlock the potential of nurseries and other nature-based solutions to achieve its ambitious climate goals. This public-private partnership has enabled the Rumpin Nursery to align with the Indonesian government's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31.89 percent unconditionally by 2030, as per the updated NDC.\n\nAs part of its efforts to support Indonesia's restoration and forestry goals, the APRIL Group recently earned an appreciation award for its role in the public-private collaboration that established the Rumpin Nursery.\n\nPT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper, the operating arm of APRIL Group, also received an appreciation award for its work to improve the performance of industrial forest plantations. Both awards were presented by Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya and received by Sihol Aritonang, president director of PT RAPP.\n\n\"APRIL is proud that our technology and seed management system can serve as a reference for nursery development in Indonesia. Through the Rumpin Nursery, we show our continuous support for one of the government's activities in achieving FOLU Net Sink 2030,\" said Sihol.\n\nIndonesia's Forestry and Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink is the newest forest policy in Indonesia that identifies the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) absorption targeted to be equal or higher than emissions in the FOLU sector in 2030. The Net Sink FOLU is projected to contribute up to 60 percent of the Net Zero Emission target by 2060 as part of the country's efforts to achieve its climate goals under the Paris Climate Agreement and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe key targets of Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030 include efforts to ensure reduced deforestation and forest degradation, the importance of sustainable forest management, social forestry and land rehabilitation, biodiversity and ecosystem preservation.\n\n",

The company is among the top European suppliers of 155mm artillery shells, tanks, armored vehicles, and other crucial military equipment to Kiev.\n\nThe Kremlin is calling it fantasy and pointing to zero evidence being presented alongside the major accusation. Here's how the bombshell CNN report published late this past week began: \"US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.\"\n\nThere have been widespread allegations for several months in Western media pointing to an irregular and covert Russian warfare campaign to conduct sabotage missions against European defense and manufacturing companies supplying Ukraine.\n\nThe CNN report alluded to these prior stories: \"The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said.\" It detailed further that \"The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.\"\n\nIn recent months, there have been several instances of fires engulfing weapons and ammo manufacturing sites in the UK and on the European continent, some of which we detailed previously. Simultaneously, Russia has been subject of similarly mysterious blazes at defense contractor buildings and companies.\n\nAs for the alleged plot to take out the CEO of Rheinmetal, the CNN story is sourced entirely to anonymous intelligence officials, making it impossible to verify at this point, other than taking the word of US, German, and NATO officials.\n\nAccording to more from the original CNN report, \"When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US.\"\n\nBut Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations as 'fake news': \"It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously,\" he said at the end of the week.\n\nGermany and the US reportedly foiled an alleged plot by Moscow to assassinate a leading German arms manufacturing firm's top executive. Why is Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger a target? pic.twitter.com/3tsi7jvxGU— DW News (@dwnews) July 13, 2024\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock belatedly appeared to confirm that the German government finds the warnings credible. \"In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months: Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression,\" she had told a press briefing at the NATO summit in Washington.\n\nPapperger himself has since described to the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a \"great deal of security around my person\" - and he's now considered to be the most highly protected private citizen in all of Germany.\n\nAnother interesting aspect to the story is the timing: the CNN revelation corresponded precisely to the close of the annual NATO summit in D.C. at a moment Western officials urged the alliance to stay the course on Ukraine, and commit to supplying more weapons for years to come.",

Healthcare information once hacked is not reversible.\n\n“Simply changing someone’s birthday is enough to disrupt the entire US online health system and fixing it would be very, very difficult.”\n\nThe expert said that a potential cyberattack on institutions would be “more crippling” than a terrorist attack.\n\nShe added: “9/11 was a shock event. It was traumatic as we had never seen anything like it before.\n\nMost read in Tech\n\n“But, the real disruption to people, companies, and systems of governance is going to be a cyberattack.”\n\nIn June 2017, the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force warned in a report that healthcare cybersecurity is in a “critical condition”.\n\nThe dossier stated: “Healthcare cybersecurity is a key public health concern that needs immediate and aggressive attention.”\n\nResearchers at the computer hardware company IBM say that healthcare firms on average take around 236 days to detect a data breach, and 93 days to mitigate the damage.\n\nThis compares to the average of 207 days to identify and 73 days to contain a cyberattack.\n\n'EASY TARGETS'\n\nAnd, US hospitals have around 10-15 networked medical devices per bed on average, meaning officials are working to secure machinery that’s easy to breach, according to Wired.\n\nAnalysts at the Brookings Institute believe “the fate of healthcare security” depends on whether investments in cybersecurity are made.\n\nThey said: “Just as a responsible healthcare professional seeks to identify and treat patients’ underlying chronic conditions before they cause a serious medical emergency, so too must responsible healthcare organizations address vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure to prevent cyberattacks.\"\n\nFears of a potential cyberattack on US institutions are rising amid the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials warned that the US is on “heightened alert” for a potential cyberattack from Moscow.\n\nRehman believes an attack on the US is \"highly likely\" should the crisis in Eastern Europe escalate.\n\nPentagon officials warned Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would result in a \"horrific\" aftermath.\n\nMoscow has amassed around 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border - something which Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he hadn't seen in the past four decades.\n\nRehman said: “A US response would probably set off what we believe will be the world’s first large-scale cyberwar.\n\nUS IN 'WARFARE STATE'\n\n“The Russians have been doing cyber-espionage and pre-positioning operations – meaning they’re setting up vulnerabilities in our infrastructure which means when they’re ready, they can release. It might not necessarily be tomorrow.”\n\nR.P. Eddy, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Ergo, warned that the US is already in a “warfare state” with Moscow, Fox News reports.\n\nHe told governors: “What’s Russia’s next move? [It’s] very likely is to increase cyberattacks. It’s an easy move for them.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\n“We are already in a warfare state right now and we need to be aware of that.”\n\nJen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), warned said officials are taking any \"rippling effects\" of a potential Russian invasion “very seriously”.\n\nWe pay for your stories!\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?\n\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheSunUS and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSunUS",

These “representatives” at Dubai’s COP28 summit decided to unite in putting an end to fossil fuels … literally the same thing they’ve said they wanted to do since the Kyoto Protocol of December 1997.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was one of the first annual “summits” held by unelected Bond villains who want to decide our fate. At the time, the countries present decided to cut fossil fuel use around the world, lest we be dead or drowning within a decade or two, which turned out to be a lie.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, these idiots still think they deserve a big annual party to celebrate the hoax that they’re doing a damn thing to help our species work in symbiosis with the natural environment.\n\nMega Rich Elite Release Video Suggesting Normal People Should Consider Eating Rotten Food https://t.co/W6xGaIID2I\n\n— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) August 7, 2022\n\nCOP28 President Sultan al-Jaber had the audacity to call their latest deal “historic.” This deal is only historic because it’s been repeated for the last 26 years, and yet nothing has ever come of it. Why? Because even if what the left said about climate change was true, there would be nothing we could do to stop the runaway process of an ever-evolving global ecosystem. (RELATED: Microchipping Your Child? ‘There Are Solid Rational Reasons For It,’ Say Supreme Overlords Of The WEF)\n\nBut the funniest comment of the week came from Norway’s minister of Foreign Affairs, Espen Barth Eide, who said: “It is the first time that the world unites around such a clear text on the need to transition away from fossil fuels.” It is literally the 26th time such an agreement has been made. And guess what happened after all the other agreements?\n\nAbsolutely nothing, other than our freedoms being removed without our consent. These people are a joke, and I don’t even know if they realize how blatantly they’re blatantly spreading propaganda. Perhaps they actually think we’re stupid enough to believe them? If so, what does that say about us?",

        "content": "The Laughing Stock of COP28 – How the UAE Event Became a Farce \n\n\nIt was always going to be a balancing act keeping the credibility of the global environmental talk shop COP28 in check while holding it in a country where they are producing fossil fuels like it is going out of fashion. It might not have been a wise choice of the UAE’s president Mohamed Bin Zaid to give the top job of presiding over the event to the oil minister and the boss of the national oil company, but it was equally unwise for Sultan al-Jabar to have used the event as a way of promoting the UAE and its oil production to other countries. Something about that smacks of shooting yourself in the foot and perhaps Mr Al Jabar’s denials and feigned innocence at the opening day press conference just made the whole fiasco even more of a farce than it already was.\n\nThe UAE tycoon just lowered himself into the vat of sulphuric acid when – in media terms – he couldn’t pull off the ultimate stunt that all politicians dream of but very few actually achieve: to lie to the press and get away with it.\n\nLazy journalists might have just left it at that. But then they started to look more closely at Mr Al Jaber who had paid Lynton Cosby, the infamous Australian media and political consultant to handle all the PR for the event – and decided that the Emirate minister’s unchecked, feral speaking needed a closer look. It didn’t take much digging to find even more controversy days earlier when he more or less mocked the science behind climate change in defence of fossil fuels, leading many to ask how did the UAE get this gig in the first place and couldn’t its elite have chosen someone with more media elan?\n\nThe failure of the event can really be determined by how media were mismanaged from the beginning when the early signs were there back in January when the Guardian launched its first attack against Mr Al Jaber questioning his credentials. That might have been a good indicator that Jaber and his team needed to listen and learn with a serious of crisis management media training sessions which Mr Cosby should have set up and wheeled in the grey haired retired journalists in London to help with the dummy interviews. But presumably, being someone who has enjoyed silencing the press – the UAE has probably one of the most servile press in the world, often with media outlets running front page stories about the elite opening a shopping mall or just repeating one of their tweets – it was little surprise that Jaber believed that the world’s press wouldn’t turn against him. The old story that when you mess up media, you become the story, became the story. Jaber, within a matter of hours, became the focus of attention by journalists who were the to find a good story and didn’t find one from the organised conferences and hullabaloo.\n\nThe UAE needs to think much more about international media if it is going to court the attention of the world. Its elite need to wake up and realise that international press whose journalists fly in and leave a few days later are working from a very different hymn sheet than the local expats who work for The National, which despite huffing and puffing and blowing hot for Jaber right from the beginning made no impact whatsoever on global opinion which has written off the event as an unprecedented PR disaster. Indeed, it was Yanis Varoufakis, a media darling and former Greek Finance minister who put it so succinctly on Twitter:\n\n“UN Chief denounces COP28’s President. What did they expect? Appointing Sultan al-Jaber, the head of UAE’s oil company, as Head of COP28 was like appointing the leader of a pack of wolves to preside over a conference on making the world vegan”. The UAE doesn’t have a satire magazine like Private Eye so we won’t pity those who were robbed of the opportunity to lay on the irony hard and thick. But the lessons are there for the royals of the UAE who must be dumbfounded by the calamity of the event and just how much the whole event has become an international laughing stock. Perhaps think about media more next time?\n",

Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.\n\nThe issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.\n\nCritics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.\n\nAdvocacy groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots warn that AI technology’s dehumanisation poses significant risks. This dehumanisation could not only impact the use of force but also permeate other aspects of our lives, extending to automation in law enforcement, smart homes, and beyond. The campaign notes the urgent need for a global treaty banning autonomous weapons to prevent the wide-scale production and proliferation of these technologies from potentially falling into the wrong hands.",

In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.\n\nPutin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”\n\nNiinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.\n\n“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”\n\n“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”\n\nThe Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.\n\nRussia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.\n\n“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.\n\n“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”\n\nSeparately, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Russia knows that NATO wants to “militarize everything within reach,” Interfax news agency reported.",

The U.K. has now backed the transparent scam. The Telegraph has more.\n\nBritain has opened the door to paying climate change reparations to developing countries by supporting talks on the issue at the COP27 summit.\n\nOn Sunday, at the meeting in Egypt, U.K. negotiators backed a last-minute agreement to address “loss and damage” payments to countries badly affected by climate-related disasters.\n\nRishi Sunak will appear at the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, where he will pledge £65.5 million for green technology in developing countries.\n\nThe Prime Minister will say: “By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth.

Many Thousands Of Deaths Later\n\nA very short while ago, any US politician or media pundit publicly calling for peace negotiations in Ukraine with Russia's Putin was branded 'pro-Kremlin' and somehow compromised. For example, mainstream media has sought to isolate and cancel thinkers like John Mearsheimer for his realism toward Moscow and the conflict, and urging immediate ceasefire which would require territorial concessions from Kiev. It was only in September that one prominent publication branded him \"the world's most hated thinker.\"\n\nBut now, at a moment Ukraine's leadership itself has become more desperate while admitting its forces are facing almost insurmountable odds, the D.C. beltway consensus has clearly and drastically changed, and now it's apparently okay to admit the following...\n\nThe War Street Journal acknowledges that the narratives it’s been pushing for months — of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, a possible palace coup in Moscow, a Russian economy in tatters — are “Magical Thinking.” In other words, their coverage has been a fraud. pic.twitter.com/ZxB25W61Kn— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 16, 2023\n\nThe WSJ piece actually calls for a longer-term strategy of confronting Russia, while also admitting that Washington's approach thus far has been based on \"magical thinking\".\n\nOr else we might just call the establishment narrative to this point fraudulent:\n\nWhat Western leaders conspicuously haven’t done is level with their publics about the enduring nature of the threat from an emboldened, revisionist Russia. They have indulged all too often in magical thinking—betting on sanctions, a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive or the transfer of new types of weapons to force the Kremlin to come to the negotiating table. Or they have hoped to see Putin overthrown in a palace coup.\n\nElsewhere in the article, the authors point out that contrary to how the Wagner rebellion was widely presented in Western press, the reality is that whole episode actually strengthened Putin:\n\nAs Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress...\n\nPutin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.\n\nThe tragedy is that so many people from both sides died for a year for nothing— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 16, 2023\n\nOf course, none of this has stopped Zelensky as well as his friends in US Congress from seeking to push through more billions in American taxpayer aid for Ukraine.\n\nOn a global level too, Moscow has made inroads and gotten closer with other well-armed powers who find themselves in Washington's crosshairs...\n\nZelensky has recently complained that \"Russia's goal\" to take the global focus away from the Ukraine war is working, particularly against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict and rising tensions in the Middle East. But certainly for now, Ukraine has taken a far backseat among the list of current Biden administration priorities, it seems. Perhaps indeed there's less \"magical thinking\" these days.\n\n* * *\n\nUS headlines with \"Ukraine winning\" in them, data via Bloomberg:",

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that the West is “fed up” with the money pit that has become this war.\n\nPlus, the U.S. has now gotten itself involved in another war between Israel and Palestine, which has the potential to advance to World War 3. Speaking at a meeting with Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Lavrov argued that “everyone is fed up” with Zelensky, the Russia 1 TV channel reported on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the broadcaster, the diplomat quoted Romanian Senator Diana Sosoaca, who directed an angry tirade at the Ukrainian president ahead of his visit to Bucharest last week. We all know that this war is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., so there’s no way the rulers are going to stop financially backing Ukraine.\n\nSosoaca called on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to prevent Zelensky, whom she described as an “arrogant and unconscionable traitor, including to his own country,” from addressing the Romanian parliament. The politician further warned of “bad” consequences should she “catch” the Ukrainian president at the parliament building. “We are going to war for Zelensky’s grain! March out of our country, godless man! If you think we will sit idly by, you are wrong!” Sosoaca stated.\n\nStop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War\n\nAccording to Romanian media, the Ukrainian leader’s planned speech to parliament was canceled during his visit last Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference alongside Johannis, Zelensky insisted that he had never intended to make an address.\n\nThe opinion of Kiev in Romania has been adversely affected by the recent inflow of cheap Ukrainian grain into the country, coupled with what some see as discriminatory treatment toward the Romanian ethnic minority in Ukraine. –RT\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings in Marrakech on Saturday, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko admitted that Kiev is being forced to make “twice the effort right now to convince our partners to provide us with support compared to the last annual meetings [in spring].” Part of that is because the U.S. has found another war to support, and one involving religion will be easier to escalate.",

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points on Wednesday, spurred into the biggest single move since 1994 by surging prices.\n\nThat may not kill inflation – but it does effectively kill Chair Jay Powell’s 2-year-old push to emphasize inclusive employment.\n\nIn the end, rising prices forced Powell’s hand. In May, the Fed chief had said he favored steady 0.5 percentage-point rate increases to contain inflation. But then Labor Department data showed consumer prices rising 8.6% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 1981. And Americans’ median expectations for inflation in May 2023 increased, according to a New York Fed survey released on Monday.\n\nThat has made the Fed’s newish framework, flexible average inflation targeting, acronym FAIT, untenable. Back in 2020, Powell said that after years of inflation below the central bank’s 2% target, it would shift to a new, flexible approach.\n\nRates would be allowed to stay near zero, even if inflation went above 2% for a while, to make sure the economy was creating enough jobs for groups like Black workers, who are often the last to benefit from economic expansions and who weren’t considered separately in the old ways of rate-setting.\n\nAggressively raising rates now risks leaving those workers in the lurch. The unemployment rate for Black Americans in May was 6.2% compared to the overall 3.6% level and 3.2% for white employees.\n\nAnd now the Fed projects the jobless pace will tick up the next few years. Elsewhere, expectations for debt delinquencies went up from April to May for those with an education level of a high school degree or less, according to the New York Fed survey. It will be for politicians, not central bankers, to decide how best to help those left behind.\n\nThere may still be room for Powell to innovate – for example, revisiting the 2% inflation target. The Fed failed to hit that on the way up for years, but the pandemic, trade wars and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have permanently altered supply chains and spending patterns.\n\nThe central bank’s June median projection for inflation this year is higher than in March at 5.2%.\n\nEven so, all newthink is best left until prices have found their level.\n",

        "content": "Geopolitics of human trafficking: How Western regime-change operations enable criminal activities \n\n\nThe slave trade in Ukraine has become one of the most serious problems of our time. Since the 2014 coup d’état, Kiev has been a key player in modern slavery, particularly for human trafficking and sexual exploitation networks. The political and social instability that has affected the country since the Western-led regime change operation is one of the main factors for the growth of such human rights violations.\n\nA recent investigative report published by the Foundation to Battle Injustice showed in details the seriousness of the slave trade in Ukraine. According to the organization, Kiev has become one of the main global hubs in the human trafficking market, with free exploitation and circulation of irregular workers – in addition to the well-known trafficking of women and children in the predatory sex market.\n\nThe study points out that more than 300,000 Ukrainians were victims of the slave market between 1991 and 2021. This situation, however, has deteriorated even further since Vladimir Zelensky came to power. It is estimated that since the beginning of Zelensky’s government, more than 550,000 Ukrainians have been enslaved. These numbers are alarming and place Ukraine as one of the main agents of human trafficking in the entire world.\n\nIn its report, citing sources familiar with the topic and several insiders, the Foundation exposed how the slave trade in Ukraine is not limited to the exploitation of Ukrainian citizens. Since 2021, two reception centers for refugees from Africa have been operating in Ternopil. These facilities were used not only for receiving migrants but also for selling them on the European black market. An alleged member of the Ukrainian Presidential Cabinet, on condition of anonymity, reported to investigators that the organizer of the Ukrainian human trafficking network is Ruslan Stefanchuk, current chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.\n\nIt is said that Stefanchuk is the main beneficiary and coordinator of human trafficking networks in Ukraine, working both in the sale of Ukrainian citizens on the international black market and in the exploitation of foreigners who arrive through migratory flows and are handed over to criminal networks in Europe. Relatives of the Ukrainian parliamentarian also appear to be involved in such activities, as a large network of private companies is legally registered in the name of people close to him, such as his brother, Mykola Stefanchuck, and his wife, Marina Stefanchuk.\n\nStefanchuk and his relatives’ companies have the function of disguising the slave trade, making it appear to be a legal business. Advertisements are made to “help” people in various ways, such as offering employment or financial assistance. Thus, migrants, refugees and vulnerable Ukrainians are lured into meetings and interviews by supposedly legal and responsible companies, but soon after the meetings their documents are confiscated, and these people are captured and handed over to criminal networks.\n\n“Everything is built to look as legal as possible. Ukrainian women, children and men are invited for interviews at respectable companies in Kiev, Ternopil, Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk. They are made tempting financial offers and paradisiacal working conditions. Then, under a plausible pretext, their identity cards are confiscated. After that, they can do absolutely anything they want with them,” source told investigators.\n\nThis type of situation is not surprising. In Ukraine, several crimes are committed with impunity by high-ranking state officials. Illegal work, sexual exploitation of women and children, military enlistment of children and even organ trafficking have been frequently reported in the country. It is worth remembering the case of Vasily Prozorov, a former Ukrainian secret service agent who emigrated to Russia and has done important work exposing Kiev’s crimes. According to him, there is a criminal network of trafficking and exploitation of Ukrainian children in pedophile schemes in which Western officials are deeply involved.\n",

        "content": "Ocean acidification claims of climate cult are based on misinformation \n\n The truth that IPCC and NOAA do not want people to know includes the fact that CO2 breaks down into three different molecules when combined with water. These molecules are collectively known as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and one of them includes bicarbonate ions that comprise more than 90 percent of the ocean's current.\n\nCarbonate ions comprise about nine percent of DIC, leaving invading CO2 levels at no more than one percent, which is inconsequential. This means that IPCC and NOAA are lying about CO2 acidifying the world's oceans when ocean waters actually contain less than one percent CO2.\n\nIt must also be noted that the other 99-plus percent of bicarbonate and carbonate ions that CO2 turns into when mixing with ocean water actually creates a buffer that prevents ocean water from acidifying. This creates what is essentially distilled water throughout ocean currents.\n\n(Related: In 2021, a handful of scientist whistleblowers exposed ocean acidification as just another climate hoax designed to fool the masses into supporting more green tyranny.)\n\nOne of the other myths being spread by IPCC and NOAA involves the false claim that acidified ocean water, supposedly caused by too much CO2, is causing the shells of ocean creatures to dissolve. This simply cannot be true for the simple fact that ocean creatures with shells have protective coatings that prevent dissolution.\n\nThe same is true for coral polyps, which have special protection that guards their reef skeletons against being eroded through acidification. And ocean water is actually more protective than distilled water at keeping these shells intact to begin with, which makes climate claims to the contrary simply ridiculous.\n\n\"Shells and reefs are made of calcium carbonate,\" writes Jim Steele. \"The hoax abuses one true scientific factoid: At a lower pH, the added H+ ions will re-join with the ocean's buffering carbonate ions.\"\n\n\"That reduces sea water's available carbonate ions by converting them to bicarbonate ion. So, alarmists' falsely claim acidification will reduce seawater's carbonate ions, making it more difficult to make calcium carbonate shells or reefs.\"\n\nPart of the climate hoax suggests that ocean shells and reefs import carbonate ions directly from seawater, but that too much CO2 inhibits this. All available evidence shows that shells and reefs only import CO2 and abundant bicarbonate ions, which are then converted internally to a carbonate ion.\n\nIn other words, CO2 from the atmosphere mixes with ocean water and turns into the exact ingredients that shells and reefs need to build strength and resiliency. CO2 actually helps them, not hurts them like the climate cult falsely claims.\n\nThe newly converted carbonate ions that result internally from CO2 mixing into water combines with calcium to form the calcium carbonate building blocks needed for reef skeletons and shells.\n\n\"Thus, any acidification that converts sea water carbonate ions into bicarbonate ions is actually helping reefs and shell-making which only absorb the critical CO2 and bicarbonate ions,\" Steele further explains.\n\n\"Knowing the real science, I can no longer trust the IPCC or NOAA's acidification alarmism misinformation.\"\n\nFurther debunking the ocean acidification myth is the fact that the CO extracted from water, both salt and fresh, by coral, mollusks and other sea life ends up becoming chalk, limestone and marble.\n\n\"Amazingly, despite what we are told, the oceans are not boiling and one can still pick up seashells at the seashore,\" one commenter wrote, adding to this sentiment.\n",

The FIO will use the data to determine whether private insurance coverage will be disrupted in areas of the nation that are vulnerable to “climate change impacts.”(RELATED: The Fed’s Plan To Battle Inflation Could End Up Making Energy More Expensive. Here’s How)\n\n“FIO’s data collection will add to the work of regulators and policymakers across the Administration to assess climate-related risks to the financial system, the U.S. economy, and the American people,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement provided by the press release.\n\nIf the regulation is implemented it would apply to all large property and casualty insurers; however, it would not apply to small insurers with policies worth less than $100 million, with the exception of those in 10 high-risk states as determined by The Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a summary of the proposal. The information would be gathered by ZIP code and would not include information about individual homeowners’ policies but would also request data from five years ago to determine market patterns.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order in May 2021 to direct the FIO to assess the risk that the “climate crisis” poses to private insurance coverage.

He denies any intention of invasion.\n\nAny U.S. and European measures against Russia in the event of an invasion “also have consequences for others, including us,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in remarks as part of a lecture series Monday night.\n\n“There’s a cost imposed on everyone,” Blinken said. “But we have done a tremendous amount of work to mitigate any effects of sanctions on those ... imposing them, as well as any retaliatory action that Russia might take.”\n\nTwo senior U.S. administration officials separately briefed reporters Tuesday about efforts by Biden’s national security team to deal with any knock-on effects from sanctions. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations.\n\nWestern embassies are also moving some of their staff out of Kyiv\n\nIf needed, Europe would look to natural gas supplies in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the United States. The effort would require “rather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources” to make up for a Russian cutoff, according to one of the officials.\n\nThe Biden administration has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin has high tolerance for the damage to Russia’s economy that would come with sanctions. But officials said the “start high, stay high” approach to penalties that they have told Moscow they would take could influence Putin’s calculations.\n\nOne official said sanctions could spur inflation in Russia “in the mid-teens” and even, according to the second official, a deep recession that would not help Putin “win hearts and minds” among his compatriots.\n\nIn the U.S., a group representing large industrial energy users and manufacturers that oppose export of U.S. natural gas appeared open to considering an exception for helping Europeans weather any possible cutoff of Russian natural gas.\n\nUkraine’s leaders are seeking to reassure their jittery citizens that an invasion from neighboring Russia is not imminent, despite a troop buildup.\n\nThe group, Industrial Energy Consumers of America, has asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to limit exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Surging U.S. exports have helped drive up natural gas prices, the group argues.\n\nPaul Cicio, the group’s president, told reporters on Tuesday that his group had not taken a position on how the U.S. should respond to tensions between Russia and Europe over natural gas.\n\n“My own personal view is that if Europe needs gas, the U.S. should be there to supply our allies,″ Cicio said, noting that China is the top recipient of U.S. gas exports.\n\n“Do we have capacity to supply our allies?

By subscribing you agree to our Terms of Use\n\nLatest Video\n\nRT reports: In an interview on Monday, Zelensky referred to comments made at the weekend by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The US politician told Fox News that he planned to move forward with a vote on an aid bill for Israel this week, without specifying when a Ukraine package would be taken up, or whether it would be tied to funding for West Jerusalem.\n\n“This is pure politics, and it’s a disgrace for the world and a disgrace for democracy,” Zelensky told PBS NewsHour. “Nobody cares how many people are dying in Ukraine every day. They only care about their approval ratings,” he added\n\nJohnson has since promised to advance the long-stalled Ukraine aid bill sought by President Joe Biden this week, multiple news outlets reported on Monday. Johnson reportedly told Republican colleagues at a closed-door meeting that he intends to allow the House to vote on a standalone bill in the coming days that would ensure additional military aid for Kiev. The House will also be expected to vote on separate bills providing more assistance to Israel and Taiwan.\n\nHouse Republicans have previously refused to back the foreign aid bill unveiled by Biden in October, which includes $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine.\n\nThe legislation has been held up for months as the GOP tries to force the White House to crack down on the influx of illegal immigrants via the southern US border. Biden’s 2024 election rival, former President Donald Trump, previously urged Republicans to block the bill, arguing against unconditional aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe delay in approving more weapons for Ukraine has rattled Zelensky and other officials in Kiev, who are blaming mounting battlefield losses on shortages of foreign-supplied ammunition and air defenses.\n\nIn his interview with PBS, Zelensky reiterated that without the US support, Ukraine “will have no chance of winning” in its conflict with Russia.\n\nMoscow, meanwhile, has repeatedly stated that no amount of foreign assistance will change the outcome of the fighting, and has accused the West of escalating the hostilities.",

By creating constant artificial scarcity of water through \"droughts\" (i.e., flagrant water mismanagement), the narrative can be spun that we are running out of water and thus must stop eating meat.\n\nWe are already seeing the consequences of all this green meddling in the form of sky-high food prices and food shortages, and what will soon become widespread famine and mass starvation.\n\nTruth be told, the ever-so-slight \"warming\" that one can, in a way, argue has been occurring – the earth goes through warming and cooling phases all the time, a simple fact check shows – has actually helped the planet by making it more green in a literal sense with more plants and improved crop yields.\n\nThe greenies are always lying about this, though. They want us to believe that unless we get rid of all meat, gas-powered cars, and industry, the ecosystems of the planet are going to collapse. This is a lie that must constantly be refuted, or else you had better start getting used to cockroach curry, mosquito marinades, and fly flakes in your pantry.\n",

Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield. Washington has invested many tens of billions of dollars into what's clearly a 'proxy war' against Russia. Asia Times wrote:\n\nWednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?\n\nThe answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.\n\nIndeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?\n\n\"The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine’s armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,\" the Asia Times report continued. \"The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.\"\n\nZelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts. This has led to waning monetary and weapons support as well.",

This would be an act of aggression that Russian President Vladimir Putin described as guaranteed to draw a harsh military response from Russia, possibly even including a nuclear strike against Berlin.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nAnd that has led to an admission by German officials that their military is woefully unprepared to take on Russia. If German generals and politicians truly want to provoke a war with Russia, they had better slow down and wait for their military to catch up to the political rhetoric coming out of Berlin.\n\nA March 14 article by John Cody at Remix News shows that the German Army lacks the personnel, equipment and infrastructure to wage a major war of any kind, let alone with a nuclear-armed military superpower like Russia.\n\n“Germany’s own military and government are painting such a dire picture of the armed forces that there are now calls from some of the most powerful politicians in the country to reinstate mandatory military service,” Cody writes.\n\nYes, a military draft.\n\nA video produced by Remix News details testimony provided by Eva Högl, German Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, who provided catastrophic details about the state of the German military. It is shocking in terms of its candor regarding the current state of the German armed forces.\n\nNEW: 🇩🇪 Germany may bring back the DRAFT.\n\nThe country’s army is falling apart, and the government now openly admits it. pic.twitter.com/KxwKPwDdSd\n\n— Remix News & Views (@RMXnews) March 13, 2024\n\nShe finds it “really impressive” that Germany has emptied out its military defense stocks by handing it over to Ukraine to be wasted in a losing war with Russia. That sounds like an admission of treason in the wide open.\n\nBut wait. There’s more.\n\nGermany knows it is incapable of taking on Russia so it is negotiating a secret deal with the insane leaders of two other European countries, France and Poland, for the very purpose of sending troops into Ukraine separate from NATO, although I do not believe this could truly be done without the acquiescence of Washington and London.\n\nAn organization called the Weimar Triangle – composed of France, Germany and Poland – has been in existence since 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe stated purpose of the Weimar Triangle was to assist Poland’s emergence from Communist rule. It’s strange that it still exists but it may have found a new purpose – instigating World War III with Russia.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, “the Weimar Triangle exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries and of their foreign ministers. The collaboration between member states includes inter-parliamentary contacts, military, scientific and cultural co-operation. The most recent summit of leaders occurred in Paris on June 12, 2023.” (Emphasis mine)",

First of all, Kyiv needs to be provided with long-range missiles.\n\nThis was the call to the West made by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in an interview with The Kyiv Independent published on Sunday, January 14. In her opinion, this is the only way to repel the aggressor country.\n\nThe head of the Estonian government reminded that Tallinn had officially decided to provide Kyiv with annual aid of 0.25% of its GDP over the next 4 years. She called on partners and allies to make the same decision.\n\nKallas said that the joint budgets of the countries that are members of the Ramstein format contact group on Ukraine's defense are \"much larger\" than Russia's budget.\n\n\"Every month, Moscow spends about 5.3 billion euros on the war. If we take the total budgets and this 0.25% of the GDP of all the states of the Ramstein coalition, it will be 120 billion. Such assistance would turn the tide in Ukraine's favor. The partners should provide Kyiv with all the military equipment they have,\" said the Estonian prime minister.\n\nThe absence of long-range weapons in the Ukrainian army gives the Russian occupation forces an advantage to seize more territories, Kallas noted.\n\n\"If they (Russians - Ed.) think they can win, then of course they don't feel threatened and just keep hitting Ukraine,\" the official said.\n\nShe also added that some Western countries are afraid that Moscow will lose and what consequences it will have. According to Kallas, the main task now is to end the war.\n\nSpeaking in the Estonian parliament on January 11, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine must win the battle against Russia because it is about the survival of the Ukrainian people.\n\nAs OBOZ.UA previously reported, the head of state called on the West to strengthen support for Ukraine.

Not long after that, the agency hopes to axe all gas cars from the market entirely.\n\nThe program would be phased in starting in 2027, when all light-duty vehicles sold new will need to meet new greenhouse gas performance standards. By 2032, between 64 and 67 percent of all new car sales would need to be EVs only.\n\n\"This is the planned rationing of vehicles,\" says Marc Morano of The Climate Depot. \"The planned rationing of American cars. That's the only way this plan makes sense ... the only result is going to be shortages of cars and a completely altered used car market.\"\n\n(Related: In case you missed it, the Biden regime also proposed a nationwide ban on gas stoves last fall, but then relented due to widespread unpopularity.)\n\nAs explained by Morano, all of this is exactly what happened to places like Cuba and East Germany, which succumbed to communism under similar circumstances.\n\n\"You can look to Cuba to find out what it's like to have a raging used car market because that's what we're looking at here,\" he warns.\n\n\"And you can look to old East Germany. East Germany had their famed Trabant car, where people would have to get on waiting lists for years to get one, and that's what we're faced with here when the government is going to mandate that you can only buy a new electric car.\"\n\nThe left-wing obsession with all things electric is nonsensical from the perspective of affordability and reliability. Earth-based fuels like oil and gas are abundant, inexpensive, and highly reliable, while electric power is expensive, unreliable, and just plain stupid.\n\nHow will the average person power his EV in the event of a power outage? What about when he becomes stranded out in the middle of nowhere with no charging stations anywhere in sight?\n\nIn the United States, at least, there is still time to stop this madness. Our country does not have to go the way of Australia, where some banks are now refusing to finance loans for people wanting to purchase gas-powered vehicles.\n\nThe World Bank is also moving in the same direction, having promised to phase out all funding for gas-powered cars in the shockingly near term.\n\n\"The powers that be, the corporate world, the bankers, the governments, academia – they've decided that gas-powered cars are over and they're putting all the forces into play to end it without our say in it,\" Morano warns.\n\nThen we have the Biden regime, which wants the imposition of new pollution limits that would force at least 54 percent of all new vehicles to be sold as electric models by the year 2030.\n\n\"I believe it's pretty doable,\" said Margo Oge, chair of the International Council on Clean Transportation and a former Obama regime EPA official. \"The industry is there. Europe is ahead of the U.S., China is ahead of Europe, and these companies are global companies.\"\n\nEverything big government is trying to do aims to stamp out freedom and liberty – but in the name of \"saving the planet.\" To learn more, visit GreenTyranny.news.\n\nSources for this article include:",

During this year’s lean season, millions of families will lack sufficient food reserves to sustain them until the next harvests in September,” said Margot Vandervelden, WFP interim regional director for Western Africa. “We must take immediate action to prevent a massive slide into catastrophic hunger,” she said.\n\nLong before last year’s flooding and Russia’s war in Ukraine, West Africa already was facing its worst food crisis in 10 years with more than 27 million hungry people mainly as a result of conflicts but also due to drought and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore than 50 million people in the wider East African region are expected to face acute food insecurity this year.\n\nFood insecurity in West and Central Africa is now affecting 47.2 million people in this year’s lean season, when hunger peaks, the WFP said, with women and children the most vulnerable groups.\n\n“Malnutrition rates have also surged, with 16.5 million children under 5 set to be acutely malnourished this year — an 83% rise from the 2015-2022 average,” the agency said.\n\nIn central Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger where jihadists have become increasingly deadly, U.N. agencies estimate that the number of people fleeing violence there has nearly quadrupled from 30,000 in January to 110,000 people in June.\n\n“We need a twin-track approach to stop hunger in the Sahel — we must address acute hunger through humanitarian assistance while tackling the structural causes of food insecurity by increasing investments in resilient food systems and expanding government social protection programs,” Vandervelden added.",

        "content": "Great Barrier Reef Doomsday Claims Should Be Audited: Scientist \n\n Australian geo-physicist Peter Ridd says an additional $5 million (US$3.3 million) allocated to the Great Barrier Reef in this week’s budget would be better spent on “genuine environmental problems.”\n\nThe funding was handed down as part of Labor’s 2024 federal budget on May 14.\n\nIn a statement released last month, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation said the reef had suffered through the “worst summer” on record, with cyclones, severe flooding, starfish outbreaks and mass bleaching.\n\nThe funds will help the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to engage tourism operators undertaking reef monitoring, protection, and stewardship.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef Foundation says the full extent of mass bleaching is not known, but claims aerial surveys over 1,000 reefs showed a rate of 73 percent bleaching within the area, plus another 6 percent in the Torres Strait.\n\nReef Subject to Constant ‘Doom-News’: RiddYet Mr. Ridd, a researcher into the Reef, believes its poor health has been greatly exaggerated.\n\n“It is telling that in the latest doom-news about the Great Barrier Reef bleaching, they failed to mention that the Great Barrier Reef had record amounts of coral in 2022/23 despite having suffered four ‘catastrophic’ bleaching events in 2016, 17, 20, and 22,” he told The Epoch Times in an email.\n\n“We ended up with twice as much coral than in 2012 when a couple of cyclones genuinely destroyed a lot of coral.\n\n“How did we end up with so much coral if those last four bleaching event were so catastrophic—even the fast-growing coral takes five to 10 years to regrow.”\n\nThe coral that bounced back, he says, is the type most susceptible to water bleaching.\n\n“That proves the last four bleaching events were exaggerated in terms of the coral death, and there is no reason to expect this latest event to be much different,” he said.\n\nMinister Says Jobs and Reef Depend on FundingFederal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek announced earlier this month that the government would also fund $17.48 million in local council projects to protect the Reef.\n\n“We are committed to protecting our precious Great Barrier Reef and supporting the 64,000 jobs that depend on it,” she said in a statement.\n\n“Protecting and restoring the Great Barrier Reef requires all levels of government and communities to work together.”\n\nBut Mr. Ridd says there’s evidence the Reef is thriving.\n\n“The latest $5 million in the budget is just a drop in a bucket of how much cash is wasted ’saving' the Great Barrier Reef, which is actually one of the most pristine ecosystems on the planet,” he said.\n\n“I estimate about $400 million are spent each year—and that is almost all wasted. We'd be better off spending it on genuine environmental problems.”\n\nMr. Ridd said the money could be used to audit the claims of widespread reef destruction.\n\n“In the Great Barrier Reef science institutions there is a great deal of groupthink, emotion, and raw self-interest to maintain the fiction that the Great Barrier Reef is in grave danger,” he said.\n\n“Dissenters are excluded and removed. The institutions need to be challenged by an official scientific ’red-team.’\n\n“The cash could also be well spent on a publicity campaign pointing out the good condition on the reef. The recurring bad news and exaggeration is very bad for the Great Barrier Reef tourist industry.”\n\nThe March 2022–23 budget allocated a $1 billion funding package over nine years to help maintain the reef.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said a wide range of funding had been put in place to protect and maintain the World Heritage listed site.\n\n“The Australian government has committed record funding of $1.2 billion in the Great Barrier Reef through to 2030, including an extra $5 million to extend the Tourism Reef Protection Initiative, so tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef can continue to play a key role in protecting this precious area,” a spokesperson told The Epoch Times.",

The lies to generate fear and justify dystopia are absolutely shocking \n\n A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries’s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it “entirely fictional” and “shameless”.\n\nProfessor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito – which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases – will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.\n\nBut Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:\n\nThe natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around –10°C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.\n\nIt is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.\n\nProfessor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:\n\nShakespeare mentions malaria – “the ague” – 13 times, so it was clearly once common here. The disease began to decline – for a multitude of reasons – in the mid-19th century, despite the upward trend in global temperatures.\n\nNet Zero Watch Director Andrew Montford said:\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen the Civil Service misleading the public in this way. Science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute.\n\nBut it seems our public officials won’t miss an opportunity to bang the climate alarmist drum as they attempt to cajole and coerce the public into accepting radical cuts in living standards to ward off threats based solely on the perennially wrong outputs of biased computer models.\n\nRead More: “Entirely Fictional, Shameless”: Top Mosquito Expert Blasts Dame Jenny Harries’s Claim That Climate Change Will Make Dengue Fever Common in U.K. Within 20 Years",

IRS whistleblower testimony in Congress under oath made it abundantly clear President Biden and his family enriched themselves at the expense of America. In short, it looks like they took treasonous bribes, and this may be just scratching the surface. How many other people in the Washington, D.C. swamp got a cut of Biden booty? We don’t know, but the evidence presented this week shows the Bidens, including the President (aka “The Big Guy”), took money from foreign sources, including China. The Constitution clearly says a President can be impeached for taking a bribe.\n\nWhile the Lying Legacy Media ignores evidence of real crime, they are reporting on the crimes being made up by the Biden Administration DOJ. The Deep State wants to jail President Trump so he cannot run in 2024 for another term in the White House. Will they use the J6 strategy that got convictions of 350 protesters at the capitol so far? It sure looks that way, and even President Trump is expecting charges soon, which is the ultimate election interference.\n\nThere is no doubt America is at war with Russia. We keep sending in arms and munitions, and there are no peace talks whatsoever. Now, a bridge linking Russia to Crimea has been blown up again, and the Russians responded by destroying a port in Ukraine that exports wheat. Higher food prices and shortages will be hitting the world soon. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is under attack, and a new global currency is going to be released by the so-called BRICS countries. Is a new currency war coming to go along with the real war already underway? The short answer is yes, and this spells big trouble to the buck.\n",

According to the latest request, the country says Israel’s military incursion in Rafah threatens the “very survival of Palestinians in Gaza”.\n\nDuring hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza, saying it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.\n\nIn January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.\n\nThe court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.\n\n“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.\n\nICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.\n\nA 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.\n\nMost of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.\n\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.\n\nSouth Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nOn Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.\n\nJoin the Belfast Telegraph WhatsApp channel\n\nStay up to date with some of Northern Ireland's biggest stories",

It's being hailed the single largest tranche of penalties slapped on Moscow since the war's start. This included export restrictions imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals.\n\n\"The American people and people around the world understand that the stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine,\" President Biden said in a statement which first unveiled the planned sanctions. \"If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going. And the costs to the United States — along with our NATO Allies and partners in Europe and around the world — will rise.\"\n\nBiden has further said the fresh action \"will ensure\" President Putin \"pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home.\" Washington has also sought to target individuals and entities connected with Navalny's imprisonment.\n\nThe new Friday statement prepared by the White House additionally stated, \"Two years ago, he tried to wipe Ukraine off the map. If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going.\"\n\nAs for \"paying the price\" - just as Biden issued these words, The Wall Street Journal observed that two years after the invasion, the \"biggest ever\" sanctions are failing and have failed:\n\nTwo years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Western sanctions have failed in their most important task—stopping the Kremlin’s war machine.\n\nWestern officials and experts say the financial, economic, military and energy sanctions imposed on Russia since February 2022 have damaged Russia’s economy and arms-production capacity, and will create serious problems for the Kremlin in the coming years. But they acknowledge the restrictions have hit more slowly than they hoped.\n\nThe report further acknowledges the merely symbolic nature of the new sanctions: \"U.S. officials privately concede that the new measures set to to be announced Friday are likely to land a limited blow.\"\n\nCould a future Trump administration make a U-turn on the Russia sanctions as part of potential negotiations to end the war?\n\n🇪🇺🇺🇦 - @ecfr data show Europeans are pessimistic about Ukraine's ability to win war— Agathe Demarais (@AgatheDemarais) February 21, 2024\n\n• Just 10% of Europeans believe Kyiv will win the war; twice as many think Russia will win\n\n• Trump 2.0 scenario may be greatest risk for Ukraine, as it could entail US U-turn on Russia sanctions pic.twitter.com/C4F5MBwVs1\n\nIn tandem, the EU also announced a new round of sanctions. \"Today, we are further tightening the restrictive measures against Russia’s military and defense sector,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stated. \"We remain united in our determination to dent Russia’s war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defense.\"\n\nThe EU sanctions target 106 more officials and nearly 90 entities that include companies, banks, and government agencies. It marks the 13th package of EU measures thus far in the war.",

The new law carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.\n\nOvsyannikova, whose father is Ukrainian and her mother Russian, spent the night in police custody.\n\n“These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn’t allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn’t provide any legal support,” Ovsyannikova said.\n\nThe court ordered her to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war.",

This is their area of responsibility — this is the outcome of their policy and rule,” Putin said.\n\nAt the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Davos that the conflict would need to escalate.\n\n\"Moscow has bluffed before with its threats. On the contrary, we need to escalate now because Putin understands only the language of force. If Russia's defeat leads to the collapse of the Putin regime, Europe may become safer and the world — freer and more democratic,\" Zelensky said.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda supported Zelensky in Davos:\n\n\"The war will end when we force the Russians out of all the occupied territories. This is obvious to me.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken, answering a question about a truce, noted in Davos that he did not see any conditions for a ceasefire.\n\n\"When you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n\nWinning the conflict is an existential question for all parties. The United States is the main instigator of the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Today, it is the US that emerges as the main obstacle on the way to a ceasefire and then peace.\n\nIf the US agreed to sign an agreement with Russia, it would be tantamount to stopping NATO's expansion to the east and thus ending the dream of US global domination and exceptionalism. The United States will be clinging to every opportunity to keep and regain geopolitical advantage. Otherwise, the US financial system based on the dominance of the dollar will crumble. That would be lethal to Washington and the US will continue using Ukraine as a bargaining chip in fierce competition with Russia.\n\nThis suggests that hostilities in Ukraine will continue indefinitely until one of the parties is completely crushed and destroyed. Therefore, Russia has no other choice but to force the Kyiv regime to capitulate.\n\nAt the same time, due to internal contradictions in the United States, there is no funding for Kyiv. Ukraine needs $5 billion a month. Without this money, Ukraine is bankrupt, including at the front. Ukraine's manpower has been exhausted, let alone its production potential.\n\nRussia has been developing its defence industry by leaps and bounds lately.\n\nAccording to Stratfor, if there is a ceasefire agreement, it will be concluded on Russia's terms. Maintaining Russia's control over Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will neutralise Ukraine and prevent its entry into the European Union and NATO in the coming years, Stratfor analysts believe. It is not clear what borders Ukraine presently has. Moreover, Kyiv's formal control over territories does not coincide with reality.\n\nTime will be working for Russia as it continues to develop its defence industry, increase the strength of its army and find ways to circumvent sanctions.\n\nRussia's victory in the conflict in Ukraine would deal a terrible blow to the image of the United States. There is no more \"as long as it takes\" — it has been replaced with \"as long as we can\", Stratfor concludes.\n\nThe outcome of the special military operation in Ukraine will become clear to everyone in four to six months.\n",

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised President Joe Biden's surprise Monday visit to Ukraine — four days from the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of the neighboring country — by saying it sends \"the right signal\" to the world.\n\n\"I am very pleased that President Biden took the time and effort to visit Ukraine, and meet with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,\" Graham said in a statement. \"This was the right signal to send at the right time. A presidential visit to Ukraine, along with the statements made by Vice President [Kamala] Harris at the Munich Security Conference that Russia is committing crimes against humanity in Ukraine, are a powerful combination.\"\n\nLast week, Harris said the U.S. has already determined that Russia committed \"crimes against humanity\" during its war with Ukraine, which launched Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nWhile meeting with Zelenskyy, Biden made a new pledge of $460 million in aid for Ukraine, according to The Washington Post.\n\nGraham would also like U.S. officials to go further with their latest investment by sending advanced fighter jets to Ukraine and designating Russia for the \"State Sponsors of Terror\" list, which currently includes Iran, Cuba, Syria, and North Korea.\n\n\"For the visits and statements to matter to their fullest extent, decisive action must immediately follow,\" Graham said.\n\n\"We must designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law. That would also help ensure any lethal assistance to Russia, provided by China, is devastating to the Chinese economy ... we should start immediately training Ukrainian pilots and maintainers, and provide them the advanced fighter jets to not only win this war, but deter future aggression.\"\n\nBiden's visit to Ukraine drew criticism from prominent Republicans, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nChief among Republican complaints: Biden visited Ukraine, which isn't a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but has yet to visit the embattled Ohio village of East Palestine, which is dealing with the fallout of a recent 50-car train derailment, toxic chemical spill, and subsequent chemical explosion.\n",

Russia also has denied it is planning an invasion, and it says the Western accusations are merely a cover for NATO’s own planned provocations.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine to annex the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Meanwhile, Moscow also backed pro-Russian separatists fighting in the eastern portion of the country known as the Donbas.\n\nNATO will “take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies,” said Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance’s secretary-general. “We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense.”\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed the United States and NATO for sword-rattling and fear-mongering.\n\n“All this is happening not because of what we, Russia, are doing. This is happening because of what NATO, the U.S. are doing,” Peskov told reporters, citing what he described as false reports that Russia is allegedly evacuating diplomats from Ukraine.

They’re possible and probable in the future,” though at this time “such a threat doesn’t exist.”\n\nOn Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told the nation that the situation is “under control,” while Reznikov affirmed Russia had not formed what he called battle groups, “which would have indicated that tomorrow they could launch an offensive.”\n\nReznikov’s and Zelensky’s statement in a bid to project calm in order not to destabilize the situation and avoid panic comes as another multi-million dollar shipment of U.S. military equipment arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday.\n\n“Our partners are increasing the amount of military assistance. And today we are meeting the third aircraft from the United States government as part of this assistance,” the defense minister said at a press briefing before the aircraft loaded with defensive aid totaling about $200 million landed at an airport in the capital of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly denied intentions to invade Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the West is showing “hysteria” and is putting out information “laced with lies.”\n\nPeskov on Tuesday again accused the U.S. of “fomenting tensions” around Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has been locked in a conflict with Russia for almost eight years.\n\nWestern concern over Moscow planning an invasion of its neighbor started after tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near the Russia–Ukraine border. In 2014, Russia used its military forces to annex the Crimean Peninsula, a move that drew sanctions from then-President Barack Obama.

The recent series of massive attacks aimed against the Republic of Crimea and the Crimean Bridge became a logical continuation of this approach.\n\nIn such conditions, Russia carried out a series of strikes on military objects placed within the Odessa port infrastructure. \n\nOn July 18, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a group strike with precision sea-based weapons against facilities involved in preparations of attacks with unmanned boats as well as a ship repair plant near Odessa, where these boats were manufactured or at least partly assembled. \n\nAdditionally, storage facilities with a total of about 70,000 tonnes of fuel were destroyed close to Nikolayev and Odessa. These facilities were used to supply fuel for the military hardware of the armed forces of the Kyiv regime. On the next day, on July 19, the Russian military delivered another round of strikes on such targets. E\n\nxplosions were reported in the countryside of Odessa, including the Illichevsk port area where a large fuel storage depot was allegedly destroyed. Other sources claim that strikes also hit positions of Ukrainian air defense facilities in the Radujniy area.\n\nThe cost of the Russian withdrawal from the grain deal and strikes on the Odessa port infrastructure for Kyiv and its puppeteers already exceeded any damage suffered by Russia from terrorist attacks aimed against Crimea. \n\nNonetheless, NATO HQs demonstrate little ability to draw conclusions from observed reality. On July 19, Crimean authorities shut down a local highway and ordered the evacuation of about 2,200 people from four settlements in the east of the peninsula. The decision was made after an ammunition depot in the area close to the evacuated villages “caught fire”. \n\nReports say that the fire was caused by a strike launched by the Kyiv regime. NATO-supplied Storm Shadow missiles were allegedly employed. \n\nBy such actions, NATO and Kyiv have been consistently pushing Russia to the long-delayed but needed decisions regarding the elimination of military infrastructure in Odessa and nearby areas.\n",

        "content": "Russia converting ordinary bombs into guided missiles, Kyiv media claims \n\n Kyiv: Russia is adapting simple bombs to include guidance systems, making them affordable and efficient alternatives to pricey guided missiles. Illia Ponomarenko of the Kyiv Independent claims that the UMPK (unified module for gliding and navigation) technologies appear to be turning ordinary bombs into intelligent ones. \n\nThe enhanced guided or gliding bombs, according to Ponomarenko, present “an especially serious threat to Ukraine” and have the ability to “deliver devastating hits upon Ukrainian lines and the rear front.” According to the site, this device can be used to give Russia’s plentiful supply of outdated Soviet FAB-500M-62 gravity bombs “wings” and a basic satellite navigation system. Russian bombs that had been modified were successfully employed in March to strike Ukrainian defences in Avdiivka, Donetsk. According to Russian media, the production of the kit costs less than 2 million roubles, or about $24,000, making it significantly less expensive than buying missiles and other weaponry from abroad. \n\nIn contrast, one Kalibr cruise missile, which Russia used frequently in its invasion of Ukraine, costs just under $6.5 million. The JDAM-ER kits, which turn existing unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, were given by the US to Ukraine, and they are identical to the system. Although Russia has not acknowledged making the UMPK kits in substantial quantities, this would be a practical substitute for pricey cruise and ballistic missiles, the stock of which is already largely exhausted. \n\nAccording to estimations from the Ukrainian air force, these weapons can have an effective range of more than 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, the Kyiv Independent said. According to the article, the Ukrainian air force calculates that up to 20 guided bomb hits are made every day along the front line by Russian Su-34 and Sukhoi Su-35 aircraft that are launched from higher heights. \n\nUkraine must use air defence systems like the S-300 to fend off the jets in order to stop the Russian attack. According to recently released Pentagon documents, Kyiv’s supply of S-300 weapons is running low and may run out in May. On Wednesday, a number of Patriot missile defence systems sent by Western partners arrived in Ukraine. Additionally, Ukraine has been frantically searching for more ammo for its air defence systems, which have been essential to protect against Russian planes. \n\nAs its Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 are obsolete and do not have contemporary longer-range air-to-air missiles, Ukraine has also been pleading for its Western friends to supply fighter jets to protect against Russian assaults. \n\nThis week, Germany granted Poland’s request to give Ukraine five MiG-29 fighter planes.

[emphasis, links added]\n\nThe implication was clear: your carbon footprint is causing the price of these commodities to sharply rise.\n\n“Total bull-bleep,” I replied.\n\nSpecifically, the story speaks of the recent drought in West Africa, which has resulted in a cocoa shortage; dry spells in Vietnam, which have reduced coffee harvests; and parched Italian olive groves and grape vineyards, which were recently destroyed by wildfires.\n\nNone of these meteorological events has anything to do with the use of fossil fuels and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nThe truth is that these regions of the world are historically well-known for witnessing wild swings in otherwise natural weather patterns.\n\nAs I explain repeatedly in my new book Climate Cult: Exposing and Defeating Their War on Life, Liberty, and Property, such misinformation feeds into an elaborate propaganda campaign designed to frighten the developed world into demanding a carbon-neutral energy grid that would be about as reliable North Korea’s.\n\nLet’s begin with West Africa, where the climate periodically exhibits large spatial and temporal variabilities that allow for recurrent droughts, some lasting hundreds of years.\n\nIn fact, the past couple of years of dry weather pales in comparison to the West African droughts in the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nAs for cocoa production, a reality missing from the discussion is that global consumers are demanding more cocoa than ever, so a blip in production impacts retail price and availability like never before.\n\nThe recent drought in Vietnam is quite serious, but I’m happy to report it’s not being caused by your SUV.\n\nWhile the lack of rain in parts of Southeast Asia is the worst since the 1930s (a decade which remains the hottest on record throughout much of the world), the drought is associated with an El Nino weather pattern.\n\nEl Nino and its sister La Nina are ancient occurrences that possess the dynamics to both enhance or diminish precipitation, depending on a variety of quite ordinary atmospheric circumstances.\n\nWildfires feeding on extremely dry vegetation have certainly taken a recent toll on olive groves in Italy and drought has impacted wine production there as well.\n\nThe journal Nature recently published a study claiming, “Climate change is affecting grape yield, composition, and wine quality. As a result, the geography of wine production is changing.” However, the publication’s editorial bias seems to have caused them to ignore the historical record.\n\nThe worst drought in modern Italy occurred in the 1920s. However, going back further, that region’s most catastrophic precipitation deficiency began in the 1530s and lasted the better part of a decade.\n\nIt was so extreme that Protestant reformer Martin Luther wondered if it was a sign of the end times. Clergy in Germany, Italy, and England urged the people to beg God for forgiveness and pray for the deliverance of rain.\n\nAs I explain in my book, those pushing the climate agenda employ ad hominem arguments that appeal to raw emotions rather than intellect.\n\nAnd, as I also detail, those on the left aren’t fond of examining history. For them, Karl Marx stated it best in his 1844 book, The Holy Family: “History does nothing; it possesses no immense wealth; it wages no battles.”\n\nBrian Sussman is a meteorologist, author, and podcaster.\n",

NOAA Research said: ‘The annual number of tropical cyclones forming globally has decreased by approximately 13% during the 20th century, and scientists say the main cause is a rise in global warming, according to a new study in Nature Climate Change by a group of international scientists including NOAA scientists.’\n\n– – –\n\nEurekAlert news release: Climate: Increasing tropical cyclone frequency may have deadly consequences for seabird populations\n\nThe increase in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity due to climate change could lead to dramatic declines in seabird populations, suggests a paper published in Communications Earth & Environment.\n\nThe authors’ conclusion is based on the impacts of Cyclone Ilsa on Bedout Island, after the cyclone killed at least 80% of seabirds nesting on the island when it struck in April 2023.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including tropical cyclones.\n\nIndividual cyclones can have a dramatic impact on wildlife populations, including seabirds. Cyclones directly affect seabirds in several ways, including causing significant mortality events, disrupting their nesting and breeding patterns, and altering migration strategies.\n\nThe increasing frequency of cyclones is already known to have negative impacts on a range of organisms, but the impact on seabird populations is still unclear.\n\nJennifer Lavers and colleagues studied the impact of Cyclone Ilsa, a category 5 tropical cyclone, on the populations of several seabird species breeding on the 17-hectare Bedout Island, Western Australia, after the cyclone crossed the island on April 13 2023.\n\nThey used aerial and ground surveys, conducted between April 17 and July 21 2023, to estimate the percentage mortality of three species — the brown booby (Sula leucogaster), the lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel), and an endemic subspecies of the masked booby (Sula dactylatra bedouti).\n\nThe authors estimate that 80–90% of these species’ populations — at least 20,000 individual birds — were killed during the storm, with the losses predominantly adult breeding birds.\n\nThe authors warn that this level of population loss for island seabirds may be unsustainable when coupled with the increase in cyclone frequency, as many seabirds are long-lived, have long generation times, and raise very few chicks per year.\n\nFull article here.\n\n– – –\n\nImage: Tropical storm [credit: BBC]\n\nThe Klimate Klowns have not made one prediction that came through Not one.

        "content": "INSPIRED BY WASHINGTON KIEV INCREASES TERRORIST ATTACKS IN RUSSIA \n\n\nThe Washington Post has recently revealed the long-known fact that the Ukrainian special services are behind the terrorist attacks on Russian territory. Moreover, Ukrainian terrorists were praised for progress they made during the years-long cooperation with their partners in the US. Inspired by fame, the Kiev regime doubled its efforts to launch more attacks against the Russians. In recent days alone, a lot of the attacks failed but some were partially successful.\n\nOn the morning of October 27, pro-Russian politician Oleg Tsarev was targeted with an assassination attempt in Crimea. He was shot and hospitalized with heavy wounds. The victim has been a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine since 2002. In 2014, he supported the referendum on independence in Donbass and served as the speaker of the Parliament of Novorossiya.\n\nUnfortunately, Oleg Tsarev was far from the first victim of the Nazi Kiev regime, which has been hunting for politicians, journalists and public figures because of their positions for more than a decade.\n\nKiev also continues attempts to launch terrorist attacks in various cities of Russia. Their goals are to inflict civilian casualties and threaten the population, as well as to discredit the Russian authorities and create the appearance of a national resistance against the Kremlin. To do this, Kiev recruits naive men, often Ukrainians who have moved to Russia, who for monetary rewards go to a life of crime and sacrifice their lives.\n\nOn October 26, the FSB announced the elimination of a Ukrainian agent who wanted to stage a terrorist attack on one of the military enlistment offices in Tver.\n\nThe man was a member of some “Ukrainian nationalist formation”. He provided Kiev with data on military, fuel and energy facilities in the region. During the arrest, the man resisted and was killed. The FSB seized homemade explosives and an RGD-5 grenade on the spot.\n\nMilitary enlistment offices are frequently targeted by the Ukrainian special services. Kiev is trying to create the appearance that Russian men do not want to fight and resist the Kremlin’s policies.\n\nCases have become frequent when Ukrainian scammers under various pretexts forced women to set fire to military enlistment offices in different Russian cities. For example, victims were assured that they should stage the attack to check the effectiveness of local emergency services and so on.\n\nSometimes Kiev shows more ingenuity to assure Washington that the years of training and funding have not passed for nothing.\n\nFor example, a Ukrainian who has been living with his family in Moscow for many years recently tried to poison Russian pilots. Disguised as a courier, he delivered a poisoned cake to their holiday. However, the operation failed, and now the Ukrainian agent will be arrested in a criminal case. Meanwhile, his Ukrainian and American curators will have to search for more naive victims in Russia.\n",

A fire that broke out on the Cycladic island of Andros on Saturday, probably caused by lightning, was brought under control by Sunday as firefighters remained in key hotspots as a precaution due to strong winds blowing in the area.\n\nFirefighting efforts focused on the front near the village of Vitali. 73 firefighters with 18 fire trucks were operating at the scene, while two aircraft and two helicopters provided assistance from the air.\n\nWith hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires however, European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of such fires, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.",

[emphasis, links added]\n\nIn reality, objective data show vanilla production has doubled since the year 2000, and the current market is saturated with oversupply.\n\nThe Times article, “This Is How the World’s Favorite Scent Disappears,” notes vanilla is the world’s favorite scent and is used in a wide variety of perfumes and other products.\n\nCiting anecdotal events like a cyclone that hit Madagascar several years ago during its annual cyclone season, the Times claims supersized cyclones are putting vanilla plants on the verge of extinction.\n\nInterestingly, although the Times published its article just yesterday, the best anecdotal “evidence” for the asserted vanilla extinction was a cyclone that hit Madagascar way back in 2017 during its cyclone season.\n\nAccording to the Times, Madagascar produces 80 percent of the world’s vanilla – actually, it produces significantly less than 80 percent – and:\n\n“As a result [of the 2017 cyclone], the price of vanilla bean pods surged to nearly $300 a pound. The increasingly erratic weather, along with pressure to cut the forests that harbor the orchids, is particularly worrisome for farmers…”\n\nSo, why does the Times provide just anecdotal ‘evidence’ of climate change ravaging vanilla crops, and why does the Times have to go back to 2017 to find any such anecdotal evidence?\n\nThe answer is that objective facts expose the Times’ claim as false.\n\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization provides detailed information on global crop production, including vanilla. According to the UN data, global vanilla production has doubled from 3.9 million kg of vanilla in 2000 to 7.7 million kg in 2022.\n\nThere is so much vanilla being produced that farmers are complaining about low vanilla prices caused by overproduction.\n\n“The 2023 vanilla crop is expected to be one of the best harvests in the last two decades, forecasted at 2,500 tons with exceptionally high quality,” observes the Nielsen-Massey 2023 Crop Report.\n\nThe Crop Report observes that recent strong production has created a market oversupply. “The oversupply has led to aggressive price reductions, posing economic challenges for vanilla farmers as they sell their 2022 crop at low prices to meet their daily living needs,” the Crop Report adds.\n\nWow, talk about the New York Times getting the story completely backward and wrong!\n\nThe New York Times points to a cyclone that hit Madagascar seven years ago during its cyclone season and caused a very short-term spike in vanilla prices.\n\nThat is its sole “evidence” of climate change making vanilla go extinct.\n\nIn reality, vanilla production is so strong that the market is saturated with vanilla, … making farmers complain about low prices.\n\nThe New York Times and other “mainstream” media outlets have a long history of identifying popular foods, beverages, and luxury items that climate change is allegedly destroying.\n\nAs is the case with all other such items that have come to Climate Realism’s attention, vanilla is becoming more abundant rather than less abundant as the planet modestly warms.\n\nTop photo of the Vanilla bean plant by Kristy An on Unsplash\n\n",

America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia’s central command — far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).\n\nHere, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government’s increasing aggression against Russia — using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:\n\nThe Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine’s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President — and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be ‘democratically elected’, and so to continue the U.S.-Government’s control over that country, on Russia’s border.\n\nFor the full details, see this.\n\nSo: all three of those phrases (“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, “unprovoked war in Ukraine”, and “Russian aggression against Ukraine”) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine — which is America’s proxy in its war against Russia — but actually Russia).\n\nThe war in Ukraine started with Obama’s coup, not with Putin’s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America’s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia’s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).\n\nAmerica’s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine’s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia’s central command — too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.\n\nWhat is the power of lies?\n\nIn a U.N. General Assembly vote on November 14th, the U.N. General Assembly (which has no power) voted by 94 votes for, 73 abstentions, and only 14 votes against, a Resolution to demand that Russia pay restitution to Ukraine, for the war in Ukraine — that America started against Russia by its 2014 coup.",

        "content": "Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions \n\n For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.\n\nThe dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nSince then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.\n\nAfter a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.\n\nSanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.\n\nSimilarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.\n\nBefore the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.\n\nBoth sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.\n\nDuring their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to “fully and unconditionally support” Moscow.\n\nRocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.\n\nFrom Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).\n\nThe MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.\n\nThe study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.\n\nThe hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.\n\nSPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.\n\nExperts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.\n\nAdditionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.\n\nIn 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.\n\nMoreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\n\nMilitary commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.\n\n“While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,” Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.\n\nIndependent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.\n\n“In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,” he told The Epoch Times.\n\n“Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.”",

Such fundamental legal foundations of world economic relations as free competition and the immunity of property have been destroyed,” the Russian diplomat noted.\n\nLavrov went on to assert that the American currency has long been used as a weapon, adding that “destructive actions” by Western nations have resulted in producing the opposite effect to the intended one. The diplomat argued that US-led sanctions aimed at isolating Russia and crippling its economy in reality have stimulated the “strengthening of multipolarity in international affairs.”\n\nAccording to Lavrov, there is a growing awareness in the world that “no one is immune” in the face of the “aggressive actions of Washington and Brussels.”\n\nHe noted that not only Russia but many other countries are now “consistently” reducing their dependence on Western currencies by switching to alternatives for foreign-trade settlements.\n\nThe global trend towards using national currencies in trade instead of the US dollar began to gain momentum last year after Ukraine-related sanctions saw Russia cut off from the Western financial system and also saw its foreign reserves frozen.\n\nAs multipolarity takes shape, more nations are working on creating new transport corridors and supply chains. Meanwhile, an “unfair” and “unbalanced” model of globalization has become outdated, Lavrov said.",

        "content": "Met Office Says it Cannot Back Up its Senior Meteorologist’s Claim on BBC Radio That Storms in the U.K. are “More Intense” Due to Climate Change \n\n The Met Office has been unable to back up a claim that storms in the U.K. are “more intense” due to the effects of climate change. The claim was made by senior Met Office meteorologist Claire Nasir on January 22nd on BBC 5 Live Breakfast in the aftermath of Storm Isha, and led to a freedom of information request for an explanation by investigative journalist Paul Homewood. The Met Office has replied that it is unable to answer the request due to the fact that the information “is not held”.\n\nIn fact the Met Office could have addressed the claim that storms are growing in intensity by referring to its own ‘State of the Climate 2022’ report:\n\nThe most recent two decades have seen fewer occurrences of maximum gust speeds above these thresholds [40/50/60 knots] than during previous decades, particularly comparing the period before and after 2000. This earlier period [before 2000] also included among the most severe storms experienced in the U.K. in the observational records including the ‘Burns Day Storm’ of January 25th 1990, the ‘Boxing Day Storm’ of December 26th 1998 and the ‘Great Storm’ of October 16th 1987. Any comparison of storms is complex as it depends on severity, spatial extent and duration. Storm Eunice [in 2022] was the most severe storm to affect England and Wales since February 2014, but even so, these storms of the 1980s and 1990s were much more severe.\n\nAn explanation for the remarks broadcast unchallenged on the BBC was provided by the Met Office, “in order to provide advice and assistance”. The statement about more intense storms being due to climate change was, the Met Office explains, in reference to “our published U.K. Climate Projections, looking at projections in the future”. This is straight out laughable, since it seeks to justify a statement firmly in the present with waffle about future modelled projections. Paul Homewood comments that it is “small wonder that so many have little confidence in the Met Office anymore”. Meanwhile, the Global Warming Policy Foundation has demanded that the Met Office retracts the “false ‘more intense storms’ claim”. The foundation notes that there is no compelling trend in maximum gust speeds recorded in the U.K. since 1969.\n\nOf course these remarks by Claire Nasir are just the latest in a long line of scares that are being spread by state-funded operations promoting the collectivist Net Zero project. In the mainstream media there is little or no push back on often outrageous and improbable claims of climate collapse and potential future human misery.\n\nIn December, the headlines were full of the news that London could suffer an endemic dengue plague by 2060 due to changes in the climate. The claim from the Health Security Agency arose from a computer model fed with an implausible rise in temperature of 3-4°C within 80 years. Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, called the claims “entirely fictional” and “shameless”. Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch commented that science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. “This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute,” he said.\n\nRead More: Met Office Says it Cannot Back Up its Senior Meteorologist’s Claim on BBC Radio That Storms in the U.K. are “More Intense” Due to Climate Change",

I am 15 years old, and I am a young writer and journalist. However, the Ukrainian government sees me just as one of many civilian targets in this war. In my short life, I have had to endure the horrors of war due to the weapons that Western countries supply to Ukraine. I know that there was recently an attempt on your life. I am very glad that the perpetrator did not succeed because human life is the greatest gift given to us by God. But the deadly threat that you face is the threat that the children of Donbass face every day at the hands of Ukraine’s extremist government.\n\nJuly 27th is the Day of Remembrance for the Children Victims of the War in Donbass. On July 27, 2014, the Ukrainian military launched a massive artillery strike on Horlivka, resulting in the deaths of 22 civilians, including children. Yes, the war in Ukraine began in 2014. Since then, the aggression of the Ukrainian authorities and army towards the civilians of Donbass has only intensified, which is why we want to live in the safety Russian Federation. The list of deceased children is only growing, as they continue to die due to the ambitions of adults. This must be stopped as soon as possible.\n\nIn one of your speeches to American voters, you said that you want to make America great again. Mr. Trump, the greatness of a country depends not only on the amount of weaponry it supplies to other countries, such as Ukraine, but also on whether this country can stop supplying those weapons that kill innocents. President Biden started the war in Ukraine, and now every day, hundreds of Ukrainians die on the battlefield. You may not consider yourself a friend of Russia, but I am sure that you can help bring this conflict to a speedy end. I also hope that Russia and the United States can establish a dialogue for the sake of mankind's future and the entire planet.\n\n",

        "content": "Washington will not let Ukraine fail, US defence chief vows \n\n RAMSTEIN AIR BASE - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised Tuesday that the United States will not let Ukraine fail in fighting off Russia, even as further aid remains stalled in Congress and Kyiv’s forces face shortages of munitions.\n\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives has been blocking $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine and the United States has warned that a recent $300 million package would only last a few weeks.\n\nThe “United States will not let Ukraine fail”, Austin said at the opening of a meeting in Germany of Ukraine’s international supporters, at which he is seeking to secure further assistance for Kyiv.\n\n“We remain determined to provide Ukraine with the resources that it needs to resist the Kremlin’s aggression,” he said. Washington announced $300 million in assistance for Ukraine last week, but Austin said it was only possible due to savings on recent purchases.\n\n“We were only able to support this much-needed package by identifying some unanticipated contract savings”, Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement the day before that it is “critically important for us that the Congress soon completes all the necessary procedures and makes a final decision” on aid for Kyiv.\n\nTop US military officer General Charles “CQ” Brown told journalists en route to the Ukraine meeting that Kyiv’s troops are “having to pay attention to their supply rates and how they execute.” There is an “incremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia”, with “incremental gains on both sides”, Brown said.\n\nBut he noted that “even as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.”\n\nAustin said in his remarks Tuesday that “Russia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin’s imperial dreams”, using “up to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.”\n\n“At least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded” since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also “sunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.”\n\nThe sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.\n\nSpeaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. “That includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,” he told journalists. Germany is Ukraine’s second biggest donor of military support, after Washington, which has committed tens of billions of dollars to aid Kyiv since February 2022.",

        "content": "Strategy needed to preserve water resources in Pakistan \n\n ISLAMABAD-Pakistan needs to chalk out an effective and feasible plan to preserve its water resources and stop the depletion of underground water, WealthPK reported.\n\nAccording to an expert, water is one of the basic necessities of life and Pakistan is blessed with an abundance of water resources. However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.\n\nSaiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.\n\nShe said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.\n\nAccording to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.",

        "content": "WEF-Aligned Dutch Gov’t Threatens To Forcibly Sieze 600 Farms For Emitting ‘Too Much Nitrogen’ \n\n The World Economic Forum-aligned Netherlands government has vowed to forcibly seize 600 farms deemed to be disrespecting the WEF’s green agenda.\n\nDutch farmers’ organizations have vowed to launch more protests in the Netherlands in response to advice from the government’s mediator, who has demanded the seizure and relocation of farming firms and the seizure of up to 600 farms deemed to be the heaviest nitrogen emitters.\n\n\nThe move by the Dutch government comes just weeks after Bill Gates was caught admitting the climate change agenda is a scam for the New World Order in a newly surfaced video in which he boasts that the term “clean energy” has “screwed up people’s minds.”\n\nAccording to Gates, who was speaking to an audience of his inner circle, wind, solar, battery technology and other renewable energy sources might be fashionable, but they are NOT capable of solving climate change.\n\nBreitbart report: Farmers Defence Force leader Mark Van den Oever announced this week that Dutch farmers will once again take to the streets after the government expressed its intentions to adopt the plan presented by former deputy prime minister Johan Remkes to meet the nitrogen standards demanded by the European Union.\n\nRemkes, who has been serving as the chief mediator between farmers’ organizations and the government in the ongoing dispute over nitrogen emissions, laid out a plan last week that would see farms located close to protected environments forcibly relocated and a scheme for the government to seize up to 600 farms that emit the most nitrogen.\n\nIn response to the plan, Van den Oever said that the scheme was “completely wrong” and that the farmers of the nation would “give the old-fashioned gas again, count on that” — in reference to the widespread tractor protests by farmers over the summer.\n\nThe Farmers Defence Force leader said that ministers have ignored the concerns of farmers and that the globalist government of Prime Mnister Mark Rutte “imposes far too much on businesses”.\n\nThe plan to relocate farms has drawn particular ire from the organisation, with spokesman Sieta van Keimpema describing the measure as a “red line” for farmers.\n\nDefending his proposals, Remkes said last week that, as a result of the European Union’s green agenda, “the Netherlands will be locked up because it will be legally almost impossible to issue permits. Not for houses, not for farms, not for roads.”\n\n“I write this with a heavy heart, but I see no other way,” he said, adding: “I don’t expect the agricultural sector will be happy with this report.”\n\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced his intentions to cut nitrogen emissions from livestock farms in half by the year 2030 in order to satisfy goals laid out in the European Union’s Natura 2000 scheme, which requires that all EU member-states remove industry or farming from areas deemed to be of ecological importance.\n\nThe government has asserted to meet the EU goals, some farms may have to reduce their emissions by as much as 95 per cent and that up to 30 per cent of all livestock farms may be shut down permanently.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the scheme, thousands of farmers staged protests throughout the country, with tractors being used to block highways and other critical infrastructure, and farmers dumping manure, tyres, and hay on motorways in defiance of the green agenda.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM in July, Dutch political commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek said that her country was being used as a testing ground for the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset, saying that “all these policies are out of those institutions and they are being implemented in our country first, we are sort of the pilot country together with Canada for this agenda.”\n\nVlaardingerbroek went on to claim that the push from the government to seize farmland was, in fact, more a result of the migrant crisis than the alleged climate crisis, explaining that the government wants the land to house migrants. While not widespread as of yet, this has already occurred, with the province of Flevoland buying up land in Noordoostpolder to build an asylum processing centre on the site of a former farm.",

        "content": "UN Chief Warns of Global Economic Crisis at World Economic Forum in Davos \n\n United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered a grim outlook on the global economic during the World Economic Forum’s 2023 summit in Davos, Switzerland, warning of a possible worldwide economic downturn.\n\nCiting the “perfect storm” of the Russia–Ukraine war, high food prices, and high energy costs, Guterres said that there will be “huge economic consequences” around the world. He did not predict, however, when the slowdown would start.\n\nGuterres noted that economies outside the United States, Europe, and Asia would face worsening economic conditions. Developing countries in Africa, South America, and much of Asia are seeing rising interest rates, he noted.\n\n“Interest rates are going up extremely in the global south. Countries are close to default. They have no resources because they couldn’t print money like the United States did, like Europe did during the COVID-19 [pandemic],” the UN chief told Bartiromo. “They have no access to concessional funding because many of them are middle-income countries. Look at small island developing states, the Caribbean islands.”\n\nSome of those countries, he added, “lived on tourism” and “tourism has ended for two years, but as they are middle-income countries, they had no debt to live, they had no concessional funding.”\n\nGuterres said that the United Nations is proposing a global stimulus plan to address economic woes, and claimed that economies should transition from oil and gas to other energy sources. “We need to do that in a just way,” he said, adding that “this transition needs to be well-managed.”\n\nMeanwhile, the West and China need to have “serious” negotiations amid the dim global economic outlook, said the UN chief.\n\nOther WarningsWhile inflation has eased at the consumer and producer level in the United States in recent months, a number of economists and business leaders say that Americans should prepare for a recession starting in 2023. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to their highest levels in decades in order to cool high inflation that reached more than 9 percent in June 2022, though it has since dropped to below 7 percent.\n\n“Some economists argue that the strength of the labor market—as well as household balance sheets—will keep the economy strong enough to avoid a recession,” wrote Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, co-founders of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, for CNN’s website. “We disagree,” they wrote, saying that “it remains our expectation that the U.S. economy will enter a recession this year.”\n\n“I’m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in a memo on company’s website on Wednesday.\n\nOther tech firms, such as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Salesforce, and Twitter, have announced similar moves in recent weeks. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, had 221,000 full-time employees as of June 30, 2022, according to government filings.",

The time has come to understand the importance of doing trade between us,\" said Ruto, while speaking at the summit of the world's three major forest basins, namely the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong Forest Basins, in Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo.\n\nRuto noted the low rate of intra-African trade and urged to reduce customs tariffs within the African continent to accelerate the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area.\n\n\"It is time we realize the importance of trading among ourselves and allowing goods, services, people and ideas to move freely across the continent,\" he said, adding that trade among East African Community countries had grown significantly due to the removal of visa requirements and tariffs.\n\nRuto said that acknowledging and providing incentives to countries in tropical forest basins for forest protection is a smart climate action.\n\nThe Amazon basin in South America, the Congo basin in Central Africa, and the Borneo-Mekong basin in Southeast Asia collectively constitute 80 percent of the world's rainforests and contain approximately two-thirds of its biodiversity. These rainforests are not only vital for their local ecosystems but also play a global role in regulating the planet's climate and sustaining life on Earth.",

        "content": "NO MORE AIR TRAVEL: Globalists want to close (nearly) all airports by 2050 to achieve “climate change” targets \n\n A report from these two schools says that with the exception of Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast, all other smaller and local airports will need to disappear by 2029 in order for the war on \"global warming\" and \"climate change\" to eventually be won.\n\nAir travelers who require regional transfers to and from the three larger airports after that time will need to take rail or a car instead, as these are considered by the globalists to be much better forms of transport for the climate.\n\nThe only way for even Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast to remain open between 2029 and 2049 is if all other airports close down by 2029, and if all air transfers within the UK be migrated to ground transfers. If that is achieved, then the Big Three can stay open until 2049.\n\nAfter that, the report states, all airports, including the Big Three, will need to be closed down permanently, leaving residents trapped right where they are. This, we are told, will \"cool\" down the planet and create a climate utopia.\n\n\"In order to meet this legal commitment, the report states that every citizen of the United Kingdom will need to 'stop using aeroplanes' for a significant period of time,\" reported The Exposé about how the scheme is outlined to work.\n\nIn order to fully comply with the Climate Change Act, airports are not the only thing that has to go. The same report states that the general public will need to stop flying as well as stop doing anything else that creates \"emissions,\" regardless of the energy source.\n\nMeat consumption, for instance, will also need to end because raising cows for beef and sheep for lamb is bad for the environment, the globalists claim. Genetically modified (GMO) soybeans and corn, on the other hand, which have to be doused in deadly chemicals in order to grow, are good for the environment and can stay.\n\nBy 2029, these climate extremists want people in the UK to reduce their meat consumption by 50 percent. The remaining 50 percent will need to be \"phased out\" between 2030 and 2049.\n\nNo more new buildings will be allowed after 2049 either. Pretty much anything that falls into the category of economic activity will need to go, which also means that all people – except for the globalists, of course – will also need to disappear in order to stop them from emitting their very existence and polluting the envisioned globalist utopia.\n\n\"The underlying point is that any asset which uses carbon will have essentially zero value in 2050,\" the report states. \"This in turn may encourage greater use in the run up to 2050 – for example, putting up new buildings at a much faster rate for the next 30 years, knowing that construction must then halt.\"\n\nThe report, by the way, was released in 2019 just prior to covid. In many ways, it serves as a blueprint for what is still to come, which is being catalyzed by the global upheaval that was foisted upon the world in the name of fighting the \"pandemic.\"\n\n\"It is possible that the events of the past two and half years are part of a larger, more sinister agenda that is only just beginning,\" is how The Expose puts it.\n\nMore related news about how stopping climate change and global warming is code for mass depopulation and genocide can be found at Climate.news.\n\nSources for this article include:",

I've donated money to Labour for many years, to help them compete and hopefully win the election. I believe they will make Britain a better country.\n\nA Labour source said: 'The onshore wind ban put up energy bills for families and made Britain more energy insecure.\n\n'By lifting the ban, this Labour Government is cutting bills for families and boosting Britain's energy independence.'",

Tommy Tuberville: “Climate Change is the Biggest Hoax in the World!… I Would Say “25% of Budget” Goes to It (VIDEO) \n\n Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville joined Steve Bannon on The War Room on Friday following Joe Biden’s incredibly partisan and completely dishonest State of the Union Address to the American people last night in Washington DC.\n\nDuring their discussion, Tommy was asked about the climate change craze. The former Auburn coach did not hold back. Tuberville told the War Room audience, “Climate Change is the biggest hoax in the world.” He then added that he believes around 25% of the budget is dumped into climate change policies.\n\nThere are obviously a whole lot of grifters getting rich of the “hoax.”\n\nThe Democrat Party and their mainstream media will not be pleased with Tommy following his honest assessment of the international scam.\n\nSteve Bannon: Okay, so you’re a common sense guy, right? Big education guy. You’ve been around universities all your life. When you come and hear the presentations, when they come and present to you, is it nonsense? I mean, is it just voodoo?\n\nSen. Tuberville: Oh, the climate, yeah. Oh, it’s biggest hoax in the world. I mean, it’s all a money grab… We come in here at our budgets about near 5 trillion a year. What we run on, we’ve spent since I’ve been here, and I hadn’t voted for any of $7 trillion more than that since we’ve been here. Right. I would say 25% of that, Steve, has gone to climate change. I mean, it is the biggest hoax in the world. I mean, you’ve got this clown Kerry. That John Kerry. He doesn’t know what day it is most of the time. I think he’s right behind Joe Biden, and he’s pushed this narrative along with these money grabbers like Clinton and Gore and all the Democrats. I mean, it is all a money grab. This EV car system, you’re seeing it now. It’s crashing, crashing, burning. They can’t get anything out of the solar, no wind…\n\n…I lived in West Texas, coach at university at Texas Tech. I had a wind turbine, huge one, in my backyard, a couple hundred yards. You could hear it going around…\n\n…But if the wind’s not blowing on that turbine behind me, it’s got an electric generator running it. Yeah, that’s fueled by gas and oil. You just have to take a deep breath sometimes and see how deep of hole these people have dug themselves.\n\nSteve Bannon: Have they presented you any information or data or analysis that would make you say, some of this climate change stuff might be logical, or is it just all presented as essentially financial, economic voodoo?\n\nSen. Tuberville: Yeah, they don’t know enough about it. Now, you can get some of these big scientists who come in and try to push, but you look at the graphs and the narratives that they bring in… It’s a hoax. I’m telling you, it is a huge hoax. We’re all for our air, our water, taking care of what we do, but they’re making money off this. And again, that’s the Democrat party. They want to make money off everything they do.\n",

        "content": "A Former Ukrainian MP Blew The Whistle On Burisma's Connections To Terrorism \n\n A Former Ukrainian MP Blew The Whistle On Burisma's Connections To Terrorism\n\nAuthored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,\n\nFormer Ukrainian MP Andrey Derkach, who’s reviled by the Biden Administration for sharing dirt about Hunter Biden’s Burisma corruption scandal with Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani ahead of the 2020 elections, just gave a very important interview to Belarus’ BelTA where be blew the whistle even louder. According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.\n\nDerkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.\n\nOn the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.\n\nAbout that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.\n\nThat’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.\n\nIn his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”\n\nLooking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.\n\nAltogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.\n\nThe dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it.",

Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.\n\nThose shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.\n\nThe final rules -- which were described by administration official as \"the strongest ever\" and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- still require a nearly 50 percent drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.\n\nThe rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.\n\nBiden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.\n\n\"I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,\" said Biden in a statement. \"Together, we've made historic progress.\"\n\nAlluding to his target set three years ago that 50 percent of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.\"\n\n- Industry given more time -\n\nEVs accounted for 7.6 percent in 2023 sales, up from 5.9 percent in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nThe original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032.\n\nCarmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.\n\nFollowing input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a \"variety of pathways\" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.\n\nThis path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.\n\nBiden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.\n\nModerating the targets in these first three years \"was the right call,\" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.\n\n\"These adjusted EV targets -– still a stretch goal –- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,\" said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.\n\n- Too many 'loopholes'? -\n\nThe final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.\n\nWednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules \"take us in the right direction,\" according to a statement from NRDC chief Manish Bapna.\n\nBut Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as \"significantly weaker.\"\n\n\"The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,\" Becker said.\n\n\"The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep wielding well-practiced delay tactics.\"",

US officials interviewed by the newspaper say the remaining funds preapproved by Congress could sustain Ukraine for about another five months. Western officials in regular contact with the US over Ukraine told the FT that Washington sees that period of time as the last real chance for Kyiv to change the situation on the ground.\n\n“We can’t keep the same level of assistance forever,” a European official told the British newspaper as he argued that the current level of support could be sustained for another year or possibly two years but no more.\n\nPolitico reported earlier this week that only $6 billion of the original $48 billion military aid package that the US had approved previously now remains. According to the US publication, Washington’s funds for Kyiv may be fully allocated by mid-summer.\n\nEuropean allies are increasingly uncertain about whether the US will come close to matching its existing $48bn package, adopted in 2022, particularly as it requires a vote in Congress this autumn against the backdrop of more partisan debate on the war, FT reported.\n\nRecently, European leaders promised Zelenskyy an arsenal of missiles, tanks and drones during a whirlwind three-day visit to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the U.K. that sought to replenish Ukraine’s depleted weapons supplies ahead of a long-anticipated spring offensive aimed at turning the tide of the war.\n\nZelenskyy’s energetic international diplomacy over 15 months of war has persuaded Ukraine’s Western allies to send ever more powerful weapons, from German Leopard tanks to U.S. Patriot missile systems and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the U.K.\n\nThe war in Ukraine that began a year ago has killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes, reduced entire cities to rubble and has fuelled fears the confrontation could slide into an open conflict between Russia and NATO.\n\nWith inputs from agencies.\n\nRead all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

It has closed its entire 1,340 km (833 mile) border with Russia for two weeks in a bid to halt an unusually large flow of asylum seekers that Helsinki says amounts to a “hybrid attack” orchestrated by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies.\n\nAsked about the Polish offer to Finland during a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “This is an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security because there is no threat there.”\n\n“The Finns must be clearly aware that this will pose a threat to us - an increase in the concentration of military units on our borders.”\n\nAny planned deployment would be unprovoked and unjustified, said Peskov.\n\nFinland’s Border Guard and the interior ministry both said they were unaware of any plan to bring Polish military advisers to Finland’s eastern border.\n\nFinnish President Sauli Niinisto held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw last week but they did not discuss military cooperation on the Finnish border with Russia, Niinisto’s office said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nFinland infuriated Russia earlier this year when it joined NATO, ending decades of military non-alignment, due to the war in Ukraine.",

In 2023, Wealth Research Group’s founder made his portfolio visible and the results were world-class! Over 15 companies reached new highs and he just made his 2024 portfolio available for us. ACCESS IT HERE!\n\nAmerican Interventionism Is Dangerous,\n\nBut Is It Worse than the Alternative?\n\nI’ve been here before, only I didn’t know it. When I born in the summer of 1984, the world had already escaped nuclear holocaust on a number of occasions, but the biggest close calls happened in the early 1980s, with one of them so close to a Soviet-American thermonuclear war that the Soviet officer who de-escalated the event is dubbed “the man that saved the world” – Stanislav Petrov.\n\nLike all incredible lucky stories, Stanislav was called to duty at the last second, because the officer originally assigned to the shift was sick.\n\nSuddenly, his screen was filled with notices of nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow ASAP and alert them that in five minutes, the entire country would be obliterated!\n\nBut something stopped him… he began reasoning that had the United States started on the path of nuclear war, they’d launch hundreds of missiles, not just a few, and decided to hold off and learn that no other station was reporting anything.\n\nSubsequently, he learned that this was a new satellite detection system that was totally useless, and that even flares from the clouds and sun could make it beep.\n\nBasically, he found out that the latest Soviet air defenses were garbage and was actually fired, instead of hailed for his deep thinking.\n\nI was born the year after Stanislav Petrov saved the world, including my own parents.\n\nNow, the Russians and NATO members are fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. France is ready to send troops to Ukraine already and, instead of having the country join NATO, it will essentially turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, but president Biden, of all people, is the one blocking it.\n\nNo wonder precious metals are soaring, but do I agree with hedge fund managers that it is overvalued?\n\nCourtesy: Zerohedge.com\n\nIn my opinion, gold is not overvalued, and its fair price is in the neighborhood of $2,582, whereas silver’s is around $37.\n\nIn the next few weeks, Biden will realize that France entering Ukraine, while showing that Washington is playing second fiddle to an emerging superpower in Europe. Washington stands to gain much from this, as it will drastically shift from policing the world to coalizing with other nations and keeping its influence, while isolating more and more, which is a very bi-partisan strategy.\n\nIf this happens, a head-on confrontation between France and Russia will send the human race back to the WW2 era, and I submit to you that French troops will then be reinforced by German, Polish and Italian ones.\n\nUkraine, in effect, will be like the Berlin Wall, separating Russia from Europe proper.\n\nIf you’re shaking your head in disbelief, just know that during Carter’s term in office, a 40c-worth chip malfunctioned once, prompting the screens to show that 2,000 Soviet warheads were en route to major American cities. Only five minutes later, when Carter was about to be notified and we were minutes away from launching a counterstrike, the operations room called to say it was a faulty chip!!!\n\nYeah, own silver… it’s going higher.\n\nComments",

        "content": "uk/DeBunked: Spiked's Ella Whelan on Oil and Renewables \n\n\nSpiked columnist Ella Whelan made misleading claims about North Sea oil and renewable energy on a recent BBC Question Time.\n\nHere is the evidence for why she’s wrong – and Spiked’s record of climate science denial and fossil fuel funding.\n\nSpiked was introduced as a “non-conformist” outlet on BBC Question Time. In fact it’s a libertarian publication with a history of climate denial and opposing green policies. E.g. In 2018 Spiked published “The Myth of a Climate Crisis” by denier Ben Pile.\n\nSpiked claims to be independent, but between 2015-18 the website received $300,000 from the Charles Koch Foundation, an arm of oil giant Koch Industries and a major funder of climate denial.\n\nOn BBC Question Time, Whelan suggested the UK government invest in “new exploration of North Sea oil” to grow the economy.\n\nThis statement ignores fossil fuels’ role driving climate impacts and the associated financial risks.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) says any new fossil fuel extraction projects are incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C.\n\nClimate change is already hurting the world economy. Under current policies climate change impacts are projected to cost the UK 7.4 percent of GDP by 2100. Meanwhile, the growing net zero sector employs 850,000 people and is adding £71 billion in Gross Value Added to the UK economy.\n\nWhelan also claimed “wind turbines and solar panels are not going to keep us warm”. In fact, heat pumps, which are powered by electricity, are considered the greenest and most efficient way to heat homes with no need for oil or gas.\n\nHer claim also plays on a common falsehood that wind and solar power are unreliable. In fact in winter 2022, renewables provided more UK electricity than gas power stations: 27 percent of UK electricity was generated by wind, and wind and solar were the EU’s top power source.\n\nThe National Grid has said the UK can switch to a 100 percent renewable grid led by wind and solar energy.\n\nIn the past, Whelan has claimed to care about climate change, for example in a 2022 interview with TalkTV. But she has also attacked – and misrepresented – efforts to do something about it.\n\nIn the same interview, Whelan said the “deluded idea of Net Zero” would mean a “dystopian” scenario in which “people have less, be more miserable, not heat your home, not eat what you want, not travel”.\n\nThese critiques are familiar “climate delay narratives”, which paint green action as disruptive and are not a true reflection of plans to reach net zero set out by the UK’s independent Climate Change Committee (CCC), or any other government policy. They also ignore the urgent need to cut emissions and transition to green energy.\n\nSpiked writers like Ella Whelan are frequently hosted on mainstream media without mention of the publication’s history of climate denial and fossil fuel funding.\n\nWe hope this thread helps inform future media appearances by Spiked columnists, so that their claims can be challenged with evidence. See more in Spiked’s DeSmog profile here.\n\n",

        "content": "A 'Watershed Event': Five Takeaways From Israel's Assassination Of Hamas' Political Leader In Tehran \n\n A 'Watershed Event': Five Takeaways From Israel's Assassination Of Hamas' Political Leader In Tehran\n\nAuthored by Andrew Korybko via substack,\n\nHamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated by Israel early Wednesday morning in the heart of the Iranian capital hours after attending President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration. The details remain unclear, but it’s widely thought that he was killed by a precision drone strike at his residence. The world is watching to see whether Iran and/or its Resistance Axis allies will respond, what form it could take if so, and whether that would escalate tensions to a wider war.\n\nHere are five takeaways thus far:\n\n1. Israel’s Intelligence & Tactics Are Top-Notch\n\nIsrael somehow or another obtained accurate intelligence about Haniyeh’s location despite it being top-secret and was then able to successfully assassinate him. Whatever air defenses (including electronic warfare ones) that Iran had deployed in its capital as part of the security measures to protect its high-profile guests failed to thwart this attack. This is a major embarrassment for the Islamic Republic and prompts speculation about whether it was due to utter incompetence or was partially an inside job.\n\n2. Iran Is Caught In A Dilemma Over How To Respond\n\nIt’s unimaginable that Iran won’t respond to its Israeli enemy assassinating a high-profile allied guest in Tehran during the new president’s inauguration, but the dilemma is over the form that this response will take. Launching another drone and missile salvo against Israel like it did in the spring after the bombing of its consulate in Damascus is possible, though Israel could spin that as a failure if many of them are shot down like last time, the on-the-ground damage is minimal, and no high-profile targets are killed.\n\n3. Mutually Assured Destruction Hangs Heavy Over Everyone’s Head\n\nThe response that Iran resorts to will be determined by its leadership’s understanding of how far they can go without triggering the “mutually assured destruction” (MAD) scenario, which both Israel and the Resistance Axis fear and is why they’ve thus far restrained themselves from waging all-out war. A repeat of spring’s salvo could remain below that threshold, but Iran might also respond in a different way that’s interpreted by Israel as an escalation, thus prompting its own escalation that could then lead to MAD.\n\n4. A Choreographed Response Might Therefore Be The Most “Rational”…\n\nDuma member Dmitry Belik, whose claim to fame was helping Sevastopol reunify with Russia when he briefly served as the region’s acting head in spring 2014, described spring’s salvo as a “beautiful theatrical production”. If there’s any truth to his innuendo that Iran choreographed its response with the US and/or Israel to Israel’s bombing of its consulate in Syria, then it might also do the same after Haniyeh’s assassination, which could help Iran “save face” while averting an escalation towards MAD.\n\n5. …But There’s No Guarantee That Iran’s Allies Will “Stand Down”\n\nHamas and Hezbollah are Iran’s allies but operate independently of it despite their close ties. There’s accordingly no guarantee that they’ll “stand down” and not respond in their own way if Iran sends another salvo to Israel regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed. After all, Hamas’ political chief was just killed, while one of Hezbollah’s top commanders was assassinated by Israel in Beirut the day prior. This makes the MAD risk even less manageable since those two might not share Iran’s calculations.\n\nHaniyeh’s assassination is a watershed event in the latest Israeli-Hamas War, which is now a regional Israeli-Iranian proxy war, since it greatly spikes the risk of everything spiraling into MAD.\n\nIran’s response will be crucial in determining whether or not that happens, but so too will Hamas and Hezbollah’s.\n\nThey’ll either “stand down” as Iran responds regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed, participate in a joint response that remains below the MAD threshold, or decide to cross that red line on their own.",

The Department is not funding research into ‘lab-grown’ or ‘fake meat’ – nor does it have plans to include such protein substitutes in service members’ MREs,” the spokesman told The Daily Wire for an article earlier this week.\n\nHowever, there is a connection between “mycoprotein” and the fake meat. The Daily Wire reported:\n\nThe grant will, however, fund a “facility for mycoprotein ingredients,” the same exact ingredient used to create the fake meat. The Daily Wire asked the Defense Department if these facilities will be used by the Better Meat Company to create fake meat during or after the grant term, but has not received a response.\n\nFake meat has been a favored tool of globalist elites and “climate change” activists because it ostensibly creates less pollution than cattle ranching, although that claim is questionable.\n\n“Within current frameworks, governments can create clear, supportive, agile and efficient regulatory processes to ensure safe and transparent pathways that instill confidence in consumers and industry players alike, fostering a robust alternative protein market in a shift towards food systems that are more sustainable, secure and just,” a World Economic Forum report claimed.\n\nThe push for “alternative protein[s]” is to help countries reach the Paris Agreement’s radical environmentalist goals.\n\nUniversity of Southern California researchers also released a paper in August of this year detailing ways to encourage people to eat less red meat and testing the effectiveness of terms like “climate change” and “climate justice.”\n\nAs LifeSiteNews reported at the time:\n\nThe paper ultimately found that a willingness to eat less red meat fell along partisan lines, with Democrats being more eager to deny themselves the nutrient dense food, which is chock full of vitamins and proteins that aid in muscle growth. Republicans, on the other hand, were “often unresponsive” to changes in terminology.\n\nThe paper concludes that “climate change communications may therefore need to go beyond terminology.” It recommended that “effective communication strategies include using compelling everyday language, presenting clear graphs, emphasizing social norms, and making climate-friendly actions the default.”\n\nThe researchers said “conservative spokespeople” could be recruited to push Republicans to embrace the “climate change” agenda.\n\nAt the same time, some states have begun fighting back against the intrusion of lab-grown meat into grocery stores and onto kitchen tables.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation in May of this year that bans the sale of lab-grown meat in the state of Florida. It is being challenged in court.\n\n“While the World Economic Forum is telling the world to forgo meat consumption, Florida is increasing meat production, and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef,” a news release stated at the time.\n\nGov. DeSantis said the Sunshine State was “fighting back against the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”\n\n“Our administration will continue to focus on investing in our local farmers and ranchers, and we will save our beef.”",

According to local news, Zinin had been called up to fight by Moscow and was prepared for deployment on Tuesday.\n\nThe news comes as countless protests have sprung up across Russia in stark defiance of Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to partially mobilize those with \"certain military specialty and relevant experience\" last week.\n\nIn part, the backlash is due to several reports indicating the mobilization is far more expansive than officially decreed.\n\nEvidence surfaced on Friday showing Russian authorities visiting Buryat State University, with one individual stating they were taking \"students straight from classes,\" Newsweek noted.\n\n\"The cops are on my campus, 10-15 people,\" a student wrote in a chat room, with a clip emerging one day later of military vehicles outside the building.\n\nThe news also breaks hours after a school shooting in the central Russian city of Izhevsk led to the deaths of 17 people, including 11 children, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe suspected gunman is 34-year-old resident Artem Kazantsev, who reportedly brandished a Nazi armband during the attack and has a history of visiting his local psychological clinic.\n\nRussian authorities have claimed the mass shooting incident, which injured at least 23 other people, is unconnected to Putin's order.\n",

        "content": "US official: Russian missiles hit NATO member Poland, killing 2 \n\n Poland Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened an emergency meeting of the country’s National Security Council after reports that a Russian missile that hit Polish territory killed two civilians.\n\nThe emergency meeting was announced by cabinet spokesman Piotr Muller on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. Muller did not reveal what the committee was due to discuss and did not offer further comment to Reuters news agency.\n\nThe committee talks, which will include senior members of Poland’s government and its intelligence services, come following unverified reports that stray Russian missiles intended for Ukraine have hit a Polish village, killing two civilians.\n\nAccording to Radio ZET, a Polish commercial radio station, “two stray rockets fell in the village of Przewodów in the Lublin province near the border with Ukraine.”\n\nRussian authorities have denied that the missiles that struck Poland came from Russia.\n\nThe station further reported that two people had died at the scene. The Polish military, the police, and the prosecutor’s office have been called to the scene.\n\nMilitary planes are also understood to have been scrambled.\n\nPolish authorities are yet to confirm media reports that Russian missiles were responsible for the explosion but they were substantiated by a senior U.S. intelligence official to the Associated Press news agency on Tuesday evening.\n\n“The causes of this incident are not known at the moment,” said Marcin Lebiedowicz, a spokesman for the Poviat Fire Brigade in Hrubieszów\n\n“We received a report of an explosion in the drying yard. In fact, upon arrival, we confirm that something like this happened. Two people died on the spot. At the moment, we are securing the scene and lighting the area of the action,” he added.\n\nKurier Lubelski, a regional Polish news outlet from the affected area has attempted numerous times on Tuesday to verify the details with state officials to no avail.\n\nAt 7 p.m. local time, the outlet was told by the local mayor’s office: “I can’t say anything about it. However, there is definitely no need to arouse anxiety. Let’s wait for the exact findings of the services.”\n\nAt 7.30 .p.m. local time, the news outlet attempted to speak again with Marcin Lebiedowicz for further information on the incident.\n\n“I’m not allowed to give any information at the moment. I suggest contacting other services,” he replied.\n\nThe local police department’s spokesperson has not been available for comment to local media, but Voivode of Lublin Lech Sprawka confirmed he was on his way to the accident site.\n\nCzech Prime Minister Petr Fiala stated that “If Poland confirms that the missiles also hit its territory, this will be a further escalation by Russia. We stand firmly behind our EU and NATO ally.”\n\nLatvia’s Deputy Prime Minister Artis Pabriks stated that the “criminal Russian regime” had hit Poland with missiles, although it is unclear what evidence he has to back his statement at this time.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said “every inch of NATO territory must be defended.”\n\nHungarian government spokesperson, Zolan Kovacs, also confirmed via Twitter that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had convened an emergency meeting of Hungary’s Defense Council for Tuesday evening “in response to missiles hitting the territory of Poland.”\n\nA U.K. Foreign Office spokesman told Sky News: “We are investigating these reports and liaising closely with allies.”\n\nRussian military launched a strong aerial assault on Ukraine on Tuesday, targeting key cities including Lviv, just 80 kilometers from the Polish border.\n\nIf reports are accurate, it will be the first time Russian projectiles have reached Poland.",

        "content": "Senate blocks sanctions aimed at stopping Nord Stream 2 pipeline \n\n The Senate blocked a measure to impose new sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany after the Biden administration warned it could disrupt allied unity in the confrontation over Ukraine.\n\nThe measure by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas failed on a vote of 55 to 44. It needed 60 votes to pass.\n\nThe vote was held open for several hours as Democrats grappled with a setback on unrelated voting rights legislation.\n\n“Russia has nakedly and unequivocally used energy as energy blackmail,” Cruz said Thursday on the Senate floor. President Vladimir Putin has done that “openly, brazenly and laughingly and absolutely nothing happened,” Cruz said.\n\nOpponents of the measure said it would damage U.S. cooperation with Germany and other NATO partners as they try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s forces deployed on its borders.\n\nThe bill “would undermine the current diplomatic situation,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who had introduced earlier sanctions proposals with Cruz. “We are in a very different situation right now” than when two earlier bills were passed.\n\nThe Biden administration also has argued that imposing new sanctions on the undersea pipeline now could undercut the US’s ability to persuade other European nations to join in severe economic penalties later if Russia invades Ukraine.\n\nThe legislation “will not counter further Russian aggression or protect Ukraine,” Emily Horne, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday. “Instead, it will undermine our efforts to deter Russia and remove leverage the United States and our allies and partners possess in this moment all to score political points at home.”\n\nThe White House backed an alternative plan from Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, that would make the sanctions contingent on Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Nearly 40 senators have signed on to that bill.\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the pipeline is what’s divisive. Unlike an older Nord Stream pipeline, the new one bypasses Ukraine.\n\n“The government of Germany should have shelved this project itself a long time ago,” McConnell said. “These sanctions, like the prior Nord Stream 2 sanctions that had overwhelming bipartisan support here in Congress, are not about driving a wedge in Europe. The pipeline itself is the wedge.”\n\nMcConnell called for a stronger stance against Russia, saying on the Senate floor that the US should extend additional humanitarian and military support to Ukraine.\n\n“We must not pull our punches out of some fear of provoking Putin,” he said. “What will encourage Putin is if he senses American weakness.”\n\nConstruction of the new pipeline is essentially complete, but Germany has yet to issue the certification required for it to begin operating.\n\n©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",

Emphasizing alignment with the principles of the ‘Make in India’ program, he highlighted the intention to contribute to local manufacturing.\n\nIn his statements, Mikheyev underlined Russia’s comprehension of the Indian government’s aspirations, acknowledging India’s commitment to achieving technological sovereignty and promoting independent industrial development. The proposed plans reflect a collaborative approach that adheres to the principles of the ‘Make in India’ initiative.\n\nEarlier, Russia signed a contract to supply Igla-S hand-held anti-aircraft missiles to India and allow production of the Igla there under licence, the Russian state news agency TASS quoted a top arms export official as saying on Tuesday.\n\nThe Igla-S is a man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) that can be fired by an individual or crew to bring down an enemy aircraft.\n\nIndia is the world’s largest arms importer and Russia remains its largest supplier despite the damage to the reputation of its army and weaponry from the war in Ukraine, where Russia has suffered numerous setbacks at the hands of a smaller but highly motivated and Western-equipped military.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia accounted for 45% of India’s arms imports between 2018 and 2022, with France providing 29% and the United States 11%.\n\nAnother Russian state news agency, RIA, quoted Mikheyev earlier as saying that “Rosoboronexport is working with Indian private and public enterprises to organise joint production of aviation weapons and integrate them into the existing aviation fleet in India”.\n\nNo details were provided about which Indian companies would be involved or when potential production would start.\n\nMikheyev said Rosoboronexport and Indian partners had provided the Indian Ministry of Defence with Su-30MKI fighter jets, tanks, armoured vehicles and shells.

Divisive content on subjects like religion and ethnicity is also littered across social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and WhatsApp.\n\nAccording to a report in Al Jazeera, “Social media allows Nigerians to share information in real-time, political strategists are weaponising this ahead of the forthcoming polls.”\n\nA BBC report in January uncovered how Nigerian politicians secretly paid social media influencers as much as 20 million Nigerian naira ($43,000) or promised government contracts and political appointments to spread disinformation about opponents. Some of these influencers are also being recruited to “situation rooms” to monitor the spread of the fake news, the report added.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria is grappling with widespread fuel shortages that are forcing motorists to spend hours in lines to buy gas and causing prices to surge for transportation and basic commodities.\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has caused prices to import fuel go up by more than 100% but retailers complain they can only charge the price set by the government, causing them to operate at a loss.\n\nThe cost of transporting gasoline to the depots has gone up by 80% in the past few months.\n\nGasoline shortages are frequent in Nigeria even though the country is one of Africa’s biggest producers of crude oil.\n\nHowever, the country must import most of its fuel because it has very few functioning refineries.\n\nRead all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

Italian press reports she rejected Hungary’s Fidesz party joining the ECR group in the EU parliament \n\n A report from Italy claims that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has rejected Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s efforts to join the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament.\n\nMeloni is currently serving as leader of the group, which is made up of a wide range of conservative and center-right parties across Europe. However, according to Italian press outlet Corriere della Sera, Meloni sees more disadvantages than advantages to Orbán joining the group.\n\nOne of the main sticking points is Orbán’s pro-peace position on the war in Ukraine. He remains opposed to sending weapons to Ukraine and is calling for an immediate ceasefire; in contrast, Meloni is pushing for more weapons and continued war against Russia, which has made her somewhat of a darling of the Brussels elite, who see her as someone they can work with, including on the issue of migration.\n\nMeloni herself has taken a notable U-turn on the issue of migration, calling for more legal migration to Italy and overseeing a huge increase in illegal migration under her rule.\n\nMeloni is looking to grow the ECR from the sixth-largest grouping in the EU parliament to the third largest. Among the parties belonging to the group are Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS), who have also shunned Orbán’s views on the war in Ukraine. The stance of other parties may have also played a role in Meloni’s decision to exclude Orbán from the group.\n\nIt is unclear how Orbán and his Fidesz party will react to Meloni’s rejection. So far, only Corriere della Sera has reported on the issue, but there has been no denial from either camp over the issue.\n\nI",

They control air defense systems for operational and tactical missiles and multiple rocket launchers, and are part of assault teams,” Rudskoy said. According to him, NATO officers directly shape the military operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\n\nThe Russian state news agency TASS reported that the bodies of soldiers with Polish and American insignia on their clothes had been found in the Russian-controlled Avdiivka.\n\n“The clearing of Avdiivka has revealed quite a few interesting details.

In order to achieve this goal, Washington and Brussels have chosen Ukraine, where anti-Russian, nationalist sentiment has been nurtured since the collapse of the Soviet Union. At present, the Ukrainian people are being used by the United States as cannon fodder for its geopolitical ambitions of world domination. Therefore, the threats to our country today are no less serious than in the years of 1941-1945 last century,” said Gen. Rudskoy.\n\nWith the fall of Avdiivka, Ukraine has lost one of the most important cities on the Donetsk frontline, Many believe that the town is now serving as a second Bakhmut, as it was clear months ago that it could only be held temporarily at the cost of tens of thousands of soldiers’ lives.\n\nContinue reading here at Remix",

        "content": "Trump's Seawall Is About His Business, Not Global Warming \n\n A Monday Politico article claims Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump could secretly care about global warming based on an application to build a seawall to protect a golf resort.\n\nIn reality, this only shows Trump uses global warming alarmism to benefit his business.\n\nA permit application for the wall by Trump International Golf Links Ireland which was reviewed by Politico explicitly cites global warming and erosion due to rising sea levels as a justification to build the structure. However, the application was prepared by an Irish environmental consulting group, not Trump’s business. The application clearly uses global warming to add urgency to a permit application to build a seawall which will protect his property from erosion and storms.\n\nTrump’s previous attempts to build the seawall failed to win special approval from Ireland’s national government, so his business resubmitted the application citing global warming as the motivating factor. The seawall would consist of 200,000 tons of rock distributed along two miles of beach in front of Trump’s property.\n\n“The zoning application raises further questions about how the billionaire developer would confront a risk he has publicly minimized but that has been identified as a defining challenge of this era by world leaders, global industry and the American military,” claims Politico. “His public disavowal of climate science at the same time he moves to secure his own holdings against the effects of climate change also illustrates the conflict between his political rhetoric and the realities of running a business with seaside assets in the 21st century.”\n\nThe real estate mogul has a long history of skepticism about global warming. Trump has taken to Twitter to call global warming a “hoax,” “mythical,” a “con job,” “nonexistent,” and “bullshit.” Trump also has a long history of questioning the benefits of politically popular green power in favor of conventional energy sources. He views policies created to fight global warming as hurting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness with China. Trump has also vowed to “at a minimum” renegotiate the United Nation’s December’s Paris climate deal.\n\nTrump has also expressed extreme skepticism of wind and solar power which environmentalists claim are the best way to prevent global warming.\n\n“I will say wind is a problem because it’s very expensive to build the towers, very, very expensive, and as you know when you have 40-dollar oil, it’s not economics, so they’re going to have to do a subsidy, otherwise wind isn’t going to work,” Trump said when pointing out problems with wind energy to The Washington Post.\n\nTrump even sued to prevent the construction of a new wind farm in Scotland which would have spoiled the view of a luxury golf resort he owns. Trump publicly stated he would stop development of the resort if the wind farm project went ahead.\n\nTrump has vehemently opposed wind power on Twitter, saying “nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy–a disaster for taxpayers” and asking “How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.”\n\nTrump’s skepticism of solar power is equally well documented, as he said in a 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren that solar panels are “economically, they’re not good. It’s a very, very poor form of energy. Solar, as you know, hasn’t caught on because, I mean, a solar panel takes 32 years — it’s a 32-year payback. Who wants a 32-year payback? The fact is, the technology is not there yet.”\n\nTrump’s stance on solar is markedly different from that of his likely Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who plans to build “half a billion” solar panels. One of Clinton’s biggest financial backers, hedge fund billionaire Warren Buffett, has invested billions into building just that type of solar panel.\n\n",

As per reports, Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff Sergei Kiriyenko issued the ‘Final word’ directive on iPhones on Monday. Those asked to abide were officials working in the presidential administration’s domestic policy, public projects, State Council, and IT departments. The directive took place during a seminar in the Moscow region earlier this month, according to the Russian newspaper, which cited sources present at the meeting. According to the Kommersant report which cited an unnamed source, officials have been instructed to replace even the finest iPhones with phones built on other smartphone software, such as Android, Chinese counterparts, or Aurora, an operating system developed by the Russian company Open Mobile Platform. \n\nIt’s interesting that this is happening at a time when governments all over the world are removing China’s TikTok from their systems and networks due to similar worries. The Moscow Times reports that the rumored iPhone prohibition coincides with the Russian government’s efforts to wean its citizens away from Western technology by establishing a “sovereign mobile ecosystem” based on the Avrora operating system. One seminar attendee was quoted in the Kommersant report as saying, “It’s all over for the iPhone: either throw it away or give it to the children”. Besides this, the Kremlin officials are not allowed to use smartphones for any official reasons. “It makes no difference what they are. \n\nRegardless of the running system—Android or iOS—any smartphone is a fairly transparent device. Naturally, they are not utilized for formal functions,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The alleged directive, reports claim coincides with ongoing campaign planning for the forthcoming Russian presidential election in 2024. Apple ceased selling products to Russia a week after it invaded Ukraine last year. But a few months later, sources claimed that Russians were still using authorized parallel importation channels to buy the new iPhone 14. Russia allegedly legalised these import programs a few months into the conflict, allowing merchants to bring goods into the nation without the owner’s consent. \n\nIt’s unknown whether all Russian government officials received the same advice to get rid of their Apple iPhones, despite reports that those within the Russian presidential administration were instructed to do so. A request for comment made prior to publication was not quickly answered by the Russian Federation’s embassy in the US. To the contrary, Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for the Kremlin, advised reporters that “smartphones should not be used for official business,” according to Reuters. Apple is yet to respond on the issue.

Nixon favorably compared the standard of living of American suburbanites to that of their Russian counterparts under Communism.\n\nCriticizing Soviet society was a serious crime in those days, but I doubt that the Russians ever considered arresting Nixon and giving him a ten year stretch in the gulag for “anti-Soviet agitation.” Not even Maoist China at the height of its Cultural Revolution would have considered such a thing.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nBut late last week, on the eve of a Russia-China leadership summit in Moscow, Europe’s International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, whose striking power is further enhanced by its revolutionary hypersonic delivery systems.\n\nThe charges against Putin were that he had ordered the humanitarian evacuation of children from the dangerous Ukraine warzone, and the ICC also ordered the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights.\n\nYet oddly enough, no ICC action had ever been taken against American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had famously declared in 1996 that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children brought about by the American economic sanctions she supported was “worth it.”\n\nIndeed, in 2016 National Security Advisor John Bolton leveled harsh threats against ICC judges if they dared take legal action against any Americans accused of torture and murder, and many have noticed the strange lack of ICC even-handedness over the years.\n\nThe International Criminal Court that we don’t recognize has issued an arrest warrant against Putin for evacuating children from a Warzone that is getting shelled with our weapons and we are the ones who killed over 20 million people in 37 victim nations since WW2. pic.twitter.com/e8ffVvChbN\n\n— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) March 18, 2023\n\nBut issuing a press release or even an arrest warrant does not necessarily determine events in real life, and the Moscow summit between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hardly been disturbed. Taken together, Russia and China control a substantial fraction of the world’s natural resources and industrial capacity, and although their global propaganda presence is weak, those former factors are more important as elements of real world power.\n\nAs an example of this, last week Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most important Middle Eastern countries, announced in Beijing that after negotiations held under Chinese auspices they had reestablished diplomatic relations despite many years of bitter hostility:\n\n- Russia, China, Iran…and Saudi Arabia?\n\nRon Unz • The Unz Review • March 13, 2023 • 3,200 Words\n\nOver the last few months, America and its Western allies have declared their unilateral right to set a cap on the price Russia charges for its oil, seeking to use their dominance over the international financial infrastructure to reduce Russian revenue on its sale of natural resources to other countries.\n\nRussia and Saudi Arabia are two of the world’s leading oil exporters, and with the latter nation now having dramatically shifted towards the Russia-China alliance, its leadership recently declared that they would ban sales to any country that sought to impose a price cap on its oil.",

Ralph Northam, the state enacted a law in 2021 that hitched it to California’s stringent vehicle emissions standards, the latest version of which will require the phase-out of internal combustion engine models by 2035. Current Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration announced Wednesday that Virginia will not be following California’s new regulations once the current set expires at the end of the year.\n\n“Once again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can’t purchase is fundamentally wrong. Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.” (RELATED: Glenn Youngkin And Virginia Universities Are In Bitter Battle Over Future Of Diversity, Equity And Inclusion On Campuses)\n\nOnce again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth.\n\n— Governor Glenn Youngkin (@GovernorVA) June 5, 2024\n\nYoungkin has opposed the policy because “California’s requirements for their citizens should not be a one size fits all solution for Virginia,” the governor’s staff previously told to the Daily Caller News Foundation. Previous efforts by state Republicans to repeal the law linking Virginia to California’s standards failed, and legislative avenues to get rid of the rules closed when Democrats cemented control of the state legislature in last fall’s elections.\n\nThe governor’s office cited a legal opinion by Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares to substantiate its decision. Miyares’ opinion asserted that the state is not obligated to abide by the California Air Resource Board’s (CARB) Advanced Clean Cars II rules, which would have taken effect at the beginning of 2025 and required EVs to make up 35% of all new car sales starting in model year 2026 on the way to 100% by 2035.\n\n“Given that EVs only amounted to 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia in 2023, application of the misguided mandates could have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties,” Youngkin’s office said in the official announcement. “Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors.”\n\nNumerous Democrat-leaning or blue states have adopted CARB’s auto emissions standards, which are more stringent than federal standards, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNeither CARB nor the office of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded immediately to requests for comment.\n",

        "content": "Climate Hypocrisy Exposed: EV Battery Production's Demand for Nickel Wreaking Havoc in Indonesia \n\n We have seen, time and again, the hypocrisy of the extreme environmental movement, especially the climate-change wing of this movement — most of whom don't live anywhere near the actual environment. From Al Gore's mansion to John Kerry's private jets to Leonardo DiCaprio's mega-yacht, these people are all really big on \"Do as we say, not as we do.\"\n\nAnd it's worth digging a little deeper into the issues behind the net-zero issue, that being the advocacy for net zero carbon emissions, something that is all but impossible. Why? Because of the things required for the manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs); specifically, their batteries and, even more specifically, the raw materials required to make those batteries.\n\nThis brings us to Indonesia and the environmental havoc that mining for nickel, an essential component of EV batteries, is wreaking on that country.\n\nSwathes of rainforest and coastal communities are being destroyed by a nickel mining boom in Indonesia sparked by the race to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nAcross the country, a major drive to exploit the country’s abundant natural resources is underway. These photographs capture the sheer scale of the production process.\n\nRows of chimneys, belching smoke and fumes, tower over the schools and houses of what were once rural communities in scenes recalling the work of L.S. Lowry, whose paintings captured life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century.\n\nIndonesia is now the world’s largest nickel producer, with 15 per cent of the globe’s lateritic nickel resources – typically low-grade deposits found near the surface.\n\nBut demand is still soaring in tandem with the rise of the electric vehicles (EVs), which depend on it for their batteries.\n\nGuess who is, in large part, funding all this?\n\nBillion dollar Chinese firms anchor the nickel market in Indonesia, but they are often fed cheap ore by hundreds of smaller, mostly locally-owned mines that dot the rainforest. These mines have transformed once-peaceful agrarian villages and communities, providing economic opportunity but a health and environmental crisis looms from pollution.\n\nIn just three years, Indonesia has signed more than a dozen deals worth more than $15 billion for battery materials and electric vehicle production with global manufacturers including Hyundai, LG and Foxconn.\n\nGranted, nickel extraction will probably go on regardless of the EV push, regardless of the net-zero goals of climate scolds, and we should remember that extraction and refining bring jobs to impoverished communities in Indonesia. That's not the point that we should be examining here.\n\nIt's the hypocrisy of the climate scolds ignoring these inescapable consequences of their agenda that's galling.\n\nSee Related: Tax Cuts for the Rich? Clean Energy Credits Mostly Go to Higher-Income Filers\n\nMUST WATCH: Guyana President Lights Up BBC Host Who Tries to Climate Shame Him Over Extracting Oil\n\nThat's always been the whole problem with these people; they never count the cost, all the costs, of the agenda for which they advocate. They are of a kind with (and in many cases are the same people) who complain about, say, my going into the woods to shoot a grouse or a snowshoe hare for supper, demanding to know why I can't get my meat at a grocery store so no animal has to die. They are of a kind with the \"Stop Oil\" protesters who block traffic for hours, forcing people to sit with their car engines idling, pouring still more exhaust into the air. They are of a kind with the Greta Thunbergs of the world, ill-informed scolds who want to dictate the end of our modern, technological lifestyles.\n\nThey never figure situations like the mining of nickel for EV batteries in Indonesia into their calculus, any more than they account for the mining of cobalt with slave labor in Congo, or mining for lithium and its accompanying environmental disturbance.\n\nTo put it bluntly, they are hypocrites of the worst sort. Why do they ignore these problems with their policies? Is it just because these particular environments are far away and out of sight of these mostly affluent, mostly Western activists?\n\nOr are they just ignorant?\n\nMy money's on \"both.\"",

        "content": "Treasury Dept Makes Rule Determination Undermining Premise of EV Tax Credits Within Inflation Reduction Act \n\n We accept the named legislation “Inflation Reduction Act” (IRA) is a legislative misnomer intended to obfuscate the true construct of the bill. The IRA was factually the ‘green new deal’ program packaged under the guise of an ‘inflation reduction’ premise. However, in order to discuss the outcome of the content we have to play the game of pretending around the purpose of the legislation.\n\nWithin the IRA there was a $7,500 tax credit for American made Electric Vehicles. The intent of the legislation was to provide incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase ‘sustainable’ and environmentally friendly electric cars, trucks, SUV’s etc made in America.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored the bill with this legislative intent in mind. However, the Treasury Department is now taking apart the granular details of the legislation in order to qualify foreign made vehicles for the $7,500 credit. The rules interpretation from the Treasury Dept essentially negates the CBO score, and the outcome is going to be much more expensive than initially stated.\n\nBecause the $7,500 comes in the form of a tax credit, the IRS (Treasury) is the institution making the determinations for qualification. Treasury is changing the qualifications to permit basically any EV to qualify, by parsing a difference between a leased vehicle and a purchased vehicle. Additionally, Treasury is changing the battery sourcing aspect by qualifying essentially any trade agreement as a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), saying the term Free Trade Agreement was undefined in the legislation.\n\nAs an outcome & simply cutting to the chase, EV batteries from just about anywhere, inside EV vehicles from basically anywhere, that are purchased as leases from just about any auto manufacturer, will qualify for the $7,500 credit. It’s all a shell game, with the Biden administration determining where the pea is located.\n\nDec 29 (Reuters) – The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday that electric vehicles leased by consumers starting Jan. 1 can qualify for up to $7,500 in commercial clean vehicle tax credits, a decision that makes those assembled outside North America eligible.\n\nThe announcement is a win for South Korea and some automakers that earlier this month sought approval to use the commercial electric vehicle tax credit to boost consumer EV access. Automakers said the credit could be used to reduce leasing prices.\n\nThe $430 billion U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August ended $7,500 consumer tax credits for purchases of electric vehicles assembled outside North America, angering South Korea, the European Union, Japan and others. The new Treasury guidance does not change the definition of what constitutes North American assembly to make more vehicles eligible for EV purchases.\n\nTreasury said it was using “longstanding tax principles” to determine consumer leasing could qualify for the EV tax credit.\n\nThe IRA also imposes significant battery minerals and component sourcing restrictions, sets income and price caps for qualifying vehicles and seeks to phase out Chinese battery minerals or components. The commercial credit does not, however, have the sourcing restrictions of the consumer credit.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, a Democrat who chairs the chamber’s energy panel, urged Treasury to pause implementation of both commercial and new consumer EV tax credits and said they had bent “to the desires of the companies looking for loopholes” and would seek new legislation that “prevents this dangerous interpretation from Treasury from moving forward.” (read more)\n\nFrom the Wall Street Journal, “One of the documents released Thursday pointed out that because the legislation doesn’t define what a free-trade agreement is, the Treasury Department might consider other types of trade agreements to expand the eligibility. The department didn’t provide examples of such agreements, but trade lawyers have suggested that the 2019 bilateral trade agreement with Japan and the World Trade Organization’s government procurement agreement could be candidates.” (link)\n\nI am reminded of the words from Democrat Congressman Alcee Hastings during the construction of the ObamaCare legislation. WATCH (10 secs):\n\n.\n\nOnce again using language to obscure reality.\n\nIt is a funny thing to see the BS passed into law and then the Treasury department”deciding” who gets the taxpayer money as an incentive to buy a car made with Cobalt mined by slaves in Africa.\n\nIndentured slaves, but non the less, it’s children doing the mining, yet it’s for the environment. I also wonder how many trans children are forced to work in this mining operation because then it would be a double tragedy for a poor black trans kid committing environmental suicide while mining the cobalt so some snot-nosed Gen Z puke can drive an environmentally friendly car.\n\nThe things I wonder about sometimes, – I know I am a racist.\n\nFunny that this is about the same amount the EV’s increased in price a few months back.",

        "content": "They want you to freeze to death: Biden, Democrats ban mining of primary fossil fuels in Minnesota \n\n Exploiting their slight edge in number in the state's House of Representatives, 70-64, the Democrats on Jan. 26 passed the historic legislation banning the mining of primary fossil fuels. This coincided with Biden banning mining in the Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota, which is marked by four major iron ore deposits. (Related: FORCE MAJEURE: Massive global shutdowns are now under way for METALS SMELTING operations covering iron, copper, nickel, aluminum, zinc and STEEL.)\n\nAccording to Alpha News, the bill on the mining ban got passed after seven hours of debate with the Republicans, who offered several amendments to make the timeline more manageable but got rejected.\n\nThe junked amendments included \"lifting the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants; allowing for the use of carbon sequestration technologies; and delaying the standard to consider its impact on child and slave labor in the green energy supply chain.\"\n\nRep. Spencer Igo (R-Wabana Township) said at a press conference ahead of the debate that the bill will make \"Minnesota reliant on nations around the globe that have no labor standards and no environmental standards. Minnesota in this bill will build a clean grid economy on the backs of child slaves in China and poor environmental regulations in Indonesia and the Congo.\"\n\nIgo lamented that the resources to build a clean energy future are right there in Minnesota, which leads the nation in iron ore production, but the federal government opted to ban mining in the state.\n\n\"The third-largest deposits of copper, nickel and cobalt that exist in the known world are only 250 miles north of this Capitol. Instead of investing in those resources … we have decided to export it around the world where carbon emissions will be 20, 25 or 30 times higher than if we were to do it here in Minnesota,\" Igo said.\n\nSecretary of the Interior Deb Haaland signed Public Land Order 7917, which withdraws around 225,504 acres of land in the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota from mineral leasing, according to a Jan. 26 press release.\n\nThe move drew criticism from mining associations and lawmakers who believe mining is necessary for the country's mineral security and could harm the interests of Twin Metals, a major mining company that seeks to build an underground mine in Ely, a small city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota.\n\nRep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), who represents the region where a proposed copper-nickel mine was to be set up by Twin Metals, called the Biden administration's decision \"an attack on our way of life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, National Mining Association CEO Rich Nolan said the decision is \"nonsensical\" considering that the U.S. is looking to be a \"leader in manufacturing, innovation and climate.\"\n\nAccording to Nolan, the government has imposed the mining moratorium at a time when the demand for minerals like nickel, cobalt and copper is \"skyrocketing\" because of their \"widespread application in solar and wind infrastructure as well as electric vehicles.\"\n\nNolan pointed out that these lands could provide U.S. manufacturers with \"plentiful sources\" of minerals apart from providing high-paying domestic jobs. Further, the country is losing out on mining operations that would have been implemented in compliance with environmental and safety regulations.\n\nOf course, these observations wouldn't be heeded by Biden and the Democrats. They want to flaunt their power with no regard for what is truly beneficial for the Minnesotans and Americans in general.\n\nWatch the video below discussing Britain's approval of its first new coal mine in decades despite its climate targets.\n\nThis video is from the Iron Age News channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBiden threatens oil firms: Do something about rising gas prices or face consequences.\n\nBiden and Harris blatantly lied when they said before the election they would not ban fracking.\n\nThe SHUTDOWNS continue in 2022: Aluminum, copper, iron, steel production being shuttered at alarming rate.\n\nSources include:",

Rand Paul notes, Johnson is also putting forward bills to ban TikTok (to silence criticism of Israel), turn American businesses into NSA spies and seize Russia’s assets to give to Ukraine in an act of war (the REPO Act).\n\nSpeaker Johnson and the Uniparty are united behind their laundry list of bad ideas. From borrowing $95 billion from China to send it to other countries to killing a FISA warrant requirement — they’re ticking all the boxes to put America last.\n\n— Rand Paul (@RandPaul) April 17, 2024\n\nFrom Reuters, “US House sets long-awaited vote on billions for Ukraine, Israel”:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives will have its long-awaited vote on aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific as soon as Saturday, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson said on Wednesday, paving the way for its possible passage despite fierce objections from the right wing of his conference.\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee unveiled legislation providing more than $95 billion in security assistance, including $60.84 billion to address the conflict in Ukraine and assist regional partners as they handle Russia’s invasion, of which $23.2 billion would be used to replenish U.S. weapons, stocks and facilities.\n\nThe effort to pass security aid gained new urgency following Iran’s unprecedented attacks on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus on April 1.\n\nThe Israel bill totals $26.38 billion, some of which will cover the cost of U.S. military operations in response to recent attacks. And $9.1 billion of the total is designated for humanitarian needs, something Democrats had demanded for them to support the bill.\n\nAs a reminder, the Intercept reported on Monday that the U.S. — not Israel — shot down the majority of the drones and missiles Iran fired at Israel.\n\nReuters continues:\n\nThe Indo-Pacific measure totals $8.12 billion.\n\nJohnson said he would give House members 72 hours from the bill’s introduction – until mid-day Saturday – to review the bill. He said the chamber would vote on final passage on Saturday evening.\n\nHe also said he would release a separate border security bill, meeting a demand from conservatives.\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden said he strongly supported the package. He called on the House to pass it this week and the Senate to quickly follow. “I will sign this into law immediately to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends, and we won’t let Iran or Russia succeed,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nThis bill is literally worse than the one they tanked a few weeks ago.\n",

Since 2019, the attendance has nearly tripled. The previous conference in Glasgow was already a record-setter, generating about 102,500 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the annual emissions of 8,000 British citizens.\n\nWith the substantial turnout expected in the UAE, there are concerns that COP28 might continue this trend of rising carbon footprints at climate conferences.\n\nRichard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, commented to The Telegraph that this event is likely to have the highest carbon footprint so far.\n\nOriginally a modest event in the mid-1990s with about 5,000 attendees, the COP conference has grown significantly, now expecting around 80 times that number. This includes both the open Green Zone, where organizations can showcase their climate actions and the secure Blue Zone, designated for official delegates and negotiations.\n\nHowever, this expansion raises concerns about the conference's own environmental impact. A significant portion of the emissions, as seen in Glasgow, comes from international flights. Additionally, the logistical needs for housing, security, and transportation for such a large number of participants add to the carbon footprint.\n\nAmid these concerns, there was criticism when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, along with other high-profile figures, chose to travel to the summit by private jet, with Downing Street defending the decision, emphasizing the importance of strong UK participation in the summit.\n\nIt also stated that the government's stance is not against flying but focuses on investing in new technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsetting, asserting that it seeks to lead in climate action without imposing flight restrictions.\n\nThis year, Graham Stuart, the Tory MP and Minister of State for Climate, will be heading the UK delegation at COP28.\n\nIn November, Stuart emphasized the importance of gradually reducing and eventually eliminating the \"unabated\" use of fossil fuels in the UK, while also noting that there is \"nothing fundamentally wrong with oil and gas.\"\n\nIan Miles Cheong\n\n",

This is an absolutely meaningless step from the point of view of ensuring their own national interests,\" Putin said.\n\n\"We generally had ideal relations with Finland, simply ideal. We did not have a single claim against each other, especially territorial ones,\" Putin continued, before saying that Finland's NATO accession was really born out of a desire to \"join the Western club\".\n\n\"We didn't even have troops; we removed all the troops from there, from the Russian-Finnish border,\" he said. \"However, it is up to them to decide. That's what they decided. But we didn't have troops there, now we will.\"\n\nFinland became the 31st member of the alliance last April, but it was on Monday that Sweden formally became the 32nd at a flag raising ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels.\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said expressly at the ceremony that his country abandoned historic neutrality as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"The Russian, brutal, full-scale invasion against Ukraine united Sweden behind the conclusion that a full-fledged NATO membership is the only reasonable choice,\" Kristersson said.\n\nOn Wednesday soaring tensions between Russia and Nordic countries were on display during new remarks of Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.\n\nHe claimed in a speech before European Parliament that Moscow is preparing for a \"long conflict with the West\" and \"represents a permanent and essential military threat to Europe.\"\n\n\"If we, as a united Europe, fail to respond sufficiently to this challenge, the coming years will be filled with danger and the looming threat of attack,\" he said, before adding: \"Russia is not invincible.\"\n\nDenmark too is among those calling for increased defense spending and greater coordination on European defense. This has been a persistent talking point over the last months as Ukraine forces are not fairing well on the battlefield, and as Washington funds have dried up. European leaders are urgently trying to fill the gap of stalled US funds to Kiev.",

Climate crazies tried — and failed — to glue themselves to Edvard Munch’s 1893 painting “The Scream” in Oslo on Friday.\n\nIt was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and John Constable’s “The Hay Wain” in London over the summer.\n\nThe new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.\n\nIn addition, “Peach Trees in Blossom” by Van Gogh; “My Heart’s in the Highlands” by Horatio McCulloch; “Tomson’s Aeolian Harp” by J.M.W. Turner; “The Last Supper” by Giampietrino; “Sistine Madonna” by Raphael; and “Haystacks” by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.\n\nAs of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.\n\nVideo of Friday’s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.\n\n“I scream for people dying,” one of the activists shouted.\n\n“I scream when lawmakers ignore science,” the other shouted.\n\nThe Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to “Stop Oil Exploration,” claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe group demands that the Norwegian government declare “an immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,” and present “a concrete plan for fair adjustment for today’s oil workers.”\n\nA spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to “pressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.”\n\n“We are campaigning against ‘Scream’ because it is perhaps Norway’s most famous painting,” said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. “There have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.”\n\nBut there’s good press and there’s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.\n\nNorway is one of the world’s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.\n\nWithout much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.\n\nThe art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:\n\n“In recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,” read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.\n\nThese climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped “problem” peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week. If they truly believe the hype surrounding climate change, they’re targeting the wrong thing.",

In another, she walks through rubble to a Rihanna music remix.\n\nThe 20-year-old photographer is among those who have not given up on the playful nature of videos considered a trademark of TikTok, which boasts more than 1 billion users.\n\n\"I try to keep the humor, because it is my nature,\" said 23-year-old TikTok creator Rimma, who asked for her second name to be withheld.\n\n\"I'm living through this trauma. My life is ruined, and there is nothing left for me but irony.\"\n\nHer TikTok clips include one of her in a basement in Odessa, quipping that Ukrainians' idea of going for a walk now is a jaunt to the nearest shelter.\n\nShe said the line between what was funny and what was hurtful was no longer clear, given the suffering and fear afflicting so many.\n\nBut the appetite for wartime content at TikTok appears strong, with Vasyuta and Shashenok seeing their accounts’ subscriber ranks multiply.\n\nYouthful sass\n\nWhile breaking news events such as armed conflicts have featured on social media for years, TikTok tends to feature spontaneity and a bit of sass that has proven particularly popular with younger audiences.\n\nIn the US where members of Gen Z, born in the late 1990s, shun traditional television, online platforms like TikTok are prime sources of news.\n\n\"I hope that the kids who watch this war unfold on TikTok become opposed to war [and] realize the horrors and dangers of it,\" said US high school history teacher Chris Dier, who is also a TikTok creator.\n\n\"What I don't want is for it to desensitize them and normalize war.\"\n\nYoung TikTok users were also being \"bombarded\" with propaganda that they likely needed help navigating, said Dier.\n\nTikTok told AFP that it had ramped up resources to detect and counter \"emerging threats\" and \"harmful disinformation\" on the platform.\n\nOn March 6, the subsidiary of China-based ByteDance suspended the uploading of videos in Russia in reaction to a new law making it a crime to \"discredit\" the Russian military.\n\nThe flow of pro-Russian messages has noticeably declined at TikTok, with the most popular account being state-backed news agency RIA Novosti, which is known for false or discredited claims, such as the alleged existence of secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine.\n\nShare your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you've encountered on The Jakarta Post.

It caused fears that the move will lead to a prolonged supply halt.\n\nThe report mentioned that benchmark futures rose toward 300 euros a megawatt hour. The electricity and coal prices also surge to fresh records.\n\nThe recent developments show that the Europeans are preparing for a difficult winter without gas supplies from Russia. It is part of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which started after Russia announced the invasion of its neighbouring country on February 24.\n\nIn the report, it is mentioned that the key Nord Stream pipeline will stop for three days of maintenance on August 31. This has raised concerns that the link won't return to service as planned after the works.\n\nThis comes after Bulgaria announced that it will seek talks with Russian energy giant Gazprom to resume deliveries of natural gas ahead of the winter season.\n\nThe deliveries were cut by Gazprom to Bulgaria in late April after the EU member's previous centrist government refused to pay in rubles.\n\nEver since the supplies were cut, the nation, which is almost totally dependent on Russia for its annual consumption of 3.0 billion cubic metres of natural gas, had been looking for alternative deliveries.\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday (August 22) at the start of a two-day trip. During this crucial trip, the two leaders are expected to discuss energy cooperation.\n\nNotable, Ukraine is at odds with Germany over its gas imports policy.\n\nEspecially regarding the deal with Moscow to build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and also the deal with Canada to get a repaired turbine for the Nord Stream 1 delivered back to Germany.\n\n",

China is among those nations that are serious about using renewable sources of energy. Norwegian diplomat and former politician, Erik Solheim recently informed via his Twitter handle that the photovoltaic (PV) power plants of China increased their production capacity to 392.61 GW in 2022. Solheim added that the China’s export of PV products grew by 80 per cent to $51.3 billion, and nearly 46 per cent of it went to Europe. He also shared a video clip where hundreds of solar panels can be seen in a solar park.\n\nHave a look at this post here:\n\nChina’s 🇨🇳 PV power plants increased their production capacity to 392.61 GW in 2022.— Erik Solheim (@ErikSolheim) March 12, 2023\n\nExport of PV products increased by 80% to US$51.3 billion, about 46% went to Europe, a year-on-year increase of 115%\n\n@DongshengNews @China4Tech\n\npic.twitter.com/PTUKVacU0n\n\nWang Bohua, honorary chairman of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, said that China’s export of solar product exceeded $50 billion for the first time last year, as mentioned in a report by Yicai Global. The export comprised panels worth $42.4 billion, silicon wafers of value $5.1 billion, and batteries amounting to $3.8 billion.\n\nAmong the main PV products, the polysilicon production of China jumped 63 per cent to 827,000 tons last year, according to Wang. Wang added that the cell production increased 61 per cent to 318 GW, while panel and wafer production increased by 59 per cent and 58 per cent to 288.7 GW and 357 GW, respectively.\n\nIn a recent development, US imports of solar panels have begun to pick up after months of gridlock stemming from the implementation of a new law that bans goods produced with forced labour, as told by two Chinese solar companies to Reuters. A White House official attributed the thaw in shipments to clearer rules for complying with the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA).\n\nThe gains come as a relief to major Chinese suppliers like Trina Solar and Jinko Solar. These suppliers are now finally getting products into the lucrative market of United States after long delays. Under the labour protection law, imports of products made in China’s Xinjiang region are prohibited. Chinese authorities have reportedly established labour camps for ethnic Uyghur and other Muslim groups in the Xinjiang region.\n\n",

In return, the Germans should agree to resuming their war against Russia on US terms.\n\nThis was known in Washington as the M PROJECT. It was devised by a group of American co-religionists, with a common ethnic origin and a shared belief in the evil of everything Russia stood for, including their religion.\n\nThe M PROJECT was the brainchild of the head of US intelligence, the White House military advisor, and other generals and admirals. They were all Irish-American Roman Catholics.\n\nThrough a special emissary code-named DAISY, they attempted to recruit their German co-religionists in the plan. To earn their reward, the Germans’ job was to arrange a coup d’état in Berlin; kill Adolph Hitler; and hurry up, before the Russian Army made good its advance through Ukraine, Poland, and on to Berlin.\n\nThis was the M PROJECT of 1943. President Franklin Roosevelt knew nothing of it. It failed, but the secret was kept for more than thirty years. By then, the US didn’t need to persuade the Germans by killing their chancellor. They do have a problem this week, though, to compel the new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to join the M&M PROJECT – that’s the old M PROJECT modernized by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his deputy Victoria Nuland, for a new push through the Ukraine front.\n\nThe Germans must hurry this time too. The M&M PROJECT is due to start on Tuesday this week, according to Bloomberg. The Times of London says it will be Wednesday. The White House national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, an Irish-American, says it will be “any day now.”\n\nOn Friday, this and a great many preceding and succeeding murder plots and invasions devised by US officials will be exposed in the new book from Dances with Bears.\n\n",

The expert recalls that during the Cold War, an acute conflict never developed into a hot stage due to the doctrine of mutually assured destruction.\n\nFor some reason, Sanders believes that NATO will be able to fight Russia without the participation of nuclear forces. Rostovsky is surprised that in Poland there are also many who want to make war with Russia.",

The largest part went into setting up power generation plants, railway tracks, and building highway infrastructure. The CPEC's western alignment was also the focus of new infrastructure projects, which connected Pakistan's most underdeveloped regions with Gwadar and major urban centres.”\n\n“Owing to China’s rapid urbanization in the last two decades, Chinese construction companies have had a lot of exposure to efficient construction techniques, which has given them a lot of expertise in these fields,” he said.\n\n“Collaborating with Chinese construction firms allows Pakistan to benefit from these high-quality standards, contributing to the construction of a durable and resilient infrastructure. This is particularly crucial in regions prone to natural disasters, as the expertise garnered from the Chinese practices can help in designing and constructing buildings that can withstand various environmental challenges,” he opined.\n\n“As the world collectively embraces the imperative of sustainable development, the Pak-China partnership aligns seamlessly with these global goals. Both nations recognize the importance of environment-friendly construction practices and adoption of green building materials.”\n\n“Through joint research initiatives and knowledge-sharing, the collaboration will be instrumental in achieving the targets related to climate action and responsible consumption and production.”\n\n“Implementing focused training programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives is crucial for cultivating a skilled and competitive construction workforce in Pakistan,” he suggested.\n\nHe further informed WealthPK that more than 5,000 trained and experienced Chinese engineers and workers and more than 2,000 Pakistani engineers and workers were involved in different projects under the CPEC.\n\nAccording to the SBP Annual Report 2023, the construction industry recorded a contraction of 5.5 percent in FY23, after registering a moderate growth in the previous two years. Increase in input prices and wages, higher borrowing costs, and slower growth in development spending are the main factors which constrained the construction activity during FY23.",

For his replacement, the Biden administration is seeking a diverse candidate that will reshape the World Bank, from its current focus on poverty alleviation to an institution with a broader focus on climate change goals such as reduced emissions, Axios reported.

But until that line or boundary, we need virtually everything ... all the way up to sabotage and property destruction.\" (Related: The New York Times similarly promoted \"sabotage\" as the \"most effective\" way to prevent environmental \"breakdown\".)\n\nClimate terrorism is already spreading like wildfire across Europe. In Marseilles, for instance, climate terrorists destroyed a cement factory because they believed it was releasing too much carbon dioxide and warming the planet. In London, climate terrorists threw tomato soup at a Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" painting as part of a \"Just Stop Oil\" protest.\n\nThere are not too many of them to begin with across the pond, but SUVs throughout Western Europe are turning up with flat tires as climate terrorists protest other people's use of larger vehicles, which they see as \"gas-guzzlers.\"\n\nThese types of things please Malm, but he craves more destruction. According to him, this is only the beginning of what climate terrorists should be doing every day to stop all use of the earth's natural energy, i.e., natural gas and oil.\n\nThe good news is that many governments are increasing the penalties and punishments for climate terrorism. Just Stop Oil activist Jan Goodey was recently sentenced to six months in prison for disrupting a major London motorway, while a few months earlier a climate terrorist named Deanna \"Violet\" Coco received a 15-month prison sentence for blocking a lane of traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge for 28 minutes.\n\n\"That's what always happens when you escalate,\" Malm said smugly on the Bloomberg broadcast. \"As soon as you pose a danger to the system, this is what you'll get in return. And that's a sign that you're doing something good, that you are actually challenging some interests.\"\n\nIn the comments, one reader wrote that he would like to see the punishments for climate terrorism become even more severe.\n\n\"Sentence them to 25 years minimum of extreme hard labor, or make them food for hungry animals,\" this person wrote. \"No animal should ever have to go hungry,\" he added jokingly.\n\nAnother wrote that true ecological activists who simply oppose needless environmental destruction have had their movements hijacked by communists who are running huge propaganda efforts to keep We the People fighting among ourselves as opposed to joining forces against these communists and their violent plans for the world.\n\n\"They are masters of destruction and of propaganda that dupes the masses into fighting among themselves instead of uniting to solve problems for everyone's benefit,\" this person wrote.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest devious machinations of the climate cult?

        "content": "Majority of Americans Believe ‘Climate Change’ Hoax but Oppose Ending Fossil Fuels \n\n Unfortunately, a new poll shows that the majority of Americans believe to some extent the unscientific climate doom propaganda that has been consistently wrong for half a century. The good news: most Americans still oppose ditching fossil fuels and gas cars altogether.\n\nPew Research Center published the results of its new survey on June 28. While climate alarmists’ predictions have been consistently and wildly wrong for 50 years now, with one unscientific claim after another proven false, the media, government, and institutions continue pounding in the narrative — and with some apparently considerable effects:\n\n- 74% of Americans say they support the country’s participation in international efforts to reduce the effects of climate change.\n\n- 67% of U.S. adults prioritize the development of alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen power over increasing the production of fossil fuel energy sources.\n\nI have previously explained in more detail how “green” energy is actually toxic for the environment, besides being inefficient and unprofitable. In other words, “green” energy is a lose-lose option. Solar panels and wind turbines have killed billions of birds, for instance, and offshore wind turbines can be deadly for whales (not to mention, wind turbines and solar panels generate plenty of toxic waste). And those “green” electric vehicles (EV)? EV batteries, which have to be replaced every few years, are very toxic to manufacture and dispose of.\n\nPerhaps Americans are starting to realize that:\n\n[Pew:] Less than half of the public (40%) favors phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. Support for this policy is 7 percentage points lower than it was two years ago. And underscoring the strong feelings big changes to American life can engender, 45% say they would feel upset if gas-powered cars were phased out; fewer than half as many (21%) would feel excited.\n\nYou mean Americans don’t want to switch to unreliable electric cars that have to depend upon an already strained grid? No way!\n\nIf Pew is to be believed, however, Americans are a little too credulous of the narrative that carbon is about to make this planet into a ball of fire. (Spoiler: it isn’t):\n\n- 76% favor providing a tax credit to businesses that develop carbon capture technologies and 70% support taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions.\n\n- 61% favor requiring power plants to eliminate all carbon emissions by the year 2040\n\nOne very simple truth that the climate alarmists don’t want you to know is that carbon is absolutely essential for life on Earth. Indeed, increased carbon actually helps plants — including food crops — thrive. Human, plant, or animal, we need carbon. So drastically reducing carbon could hurt humans and devastate crops and plants.\n\nIreland to require farmers to reduce cattle herds by one-third by 2030 to save planet.\n\nFarmers to reduce carbon footprint through bankruptcy.https://t.co/YyZGxlPLNm\n\n— Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) February 7, 2023\n\nBy the way, a recent study found that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are too low to cause global warming. That seems like important information, but don’t expect to see it in the mainstream media.\n\nRelated: WATCH: Cricketer Carries Climate Protester Off the Field\n\nIt is disappointing that so many Americans believe to some degree in the climate hoax after all these years. But it is encouraging that Americans are not falling hook, line, and sinker for some of the lies around electric vehicles and fossil fuels.\n\nWe don’t need to give up our cars to save the planet. It’s all just a political deception.\n\nJoin the conversation as a VIP Member",

        "content": "Green propaganda is masking real statistics \n\n The Royal College of Physicians has abandoned science, and become a green ideological campaigning organisation.\n\nThe RCP’s “green physician toolkit” is precisely the same patronising nonsense as the WHO’s toolkit of the same name, discussed in my Daily Sceptic article a few months ago.\n\nThe two main ideas behind the toolkit are\n\na) that doctors routinely make “unnecessary” decisions that have environmental impact, and that\n\nb) they should use their authority to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nFor example “reduce blood testing where clinically appropriate”. This assumes that doctors test people’s blood frivolously, something equivalent to an “unnecessary journey”. Very, very odd.\n\nBut the most egregious claim, of course, is that “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to human health”.\n\nThat is so far from truthful, and so utterly embedded in green ideology, that the word “lie” is not sufficient.\n\nThere is less than zero evidence that climate is a “threat to human health”, let alone the “biggest threat”. The evidence debunking the link between climate change and health is so strong that doctors have to go out of their way to conceal the stats.\n\nYou can see the raw data here for yourself. Climate-related mortality has fallen in recent decades. Diseases of poverty, which are claimed to be climate-linked, including malaria, are also in steep decline.\n\nI give an overview of how climate-activist doctors at the Lancet are influenced by ideology here, and go into more detail to explain how they lie in this presentation below. At around 36 mins, I show that the Lancet’s green propaganda pages hide the mortality statistics behind “frequency of event” statistics, to give the opposite impression.\n\nThe Lancet claims that “life-threatening extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent”. When you interrogate the data, however, it reveals that far fewer people are being killed by extreme weather.\n\nSo it’s not just a lie, it’s a fraud. And it’s a fraud told for political effect, to transform society and the economy, which ultimately will have a devastating effect on human health. And it already is, if we calculate the opportunity cost for people in emerging economies.\n\nDoctors and medical researchers involved in this propaganda have invented their own metric of “risk” to create “evidence” of a growing “threat”. And doctors and institutions of medicine that reproduce this propaganda do so *uncritically* without checking the numbers.\n\nThe numbers are not complicated. The science is not complicated. The data is not hard to find. This is not like 5-sigma high energy physics experimentation.\n\nConsider this chart from the latest Lancet propaganda report, for example. It claims that the better part of a $trillion is lost from agricultural production because of exposure to heat. But look at how small that effect is in the West, compared to developing/low income economies.\n\nWhereas farmers in the US can tend to vast farms, sitting in GPS-guided, air conditioned, diesel-powered tractors, subsistence agriculture is dawn-to-dusk manual labour.\n\nThe difference is access to fossil fuels. It’s not a weather or climate effect.\n\nTo frame that disparity between agricultural producers in the richest and poorest economies as one of “climate change”, requiring the abolition of fossil fuels is a grotesque injustice. It is vile.\n",

Regarding the leadership of both nations, 54 percent approve of President Joe Biden, while 19 percent feel the same way about Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nA total of 30,861 adults were surveyed from Feb. 20 to May 22, 2023.\n\nAcross countries surveyed, Kenya and Nigeria hold more favorable views of China than the United States. But their ratings for Washington and Beijing are positive, with a favorable view of over 70 percent.\n\nThe survey also showed that public opinions for the United States and China vary across the countries surveyed.\n\nIn high-income countries, the differences in favor of the United States compared to China are much larger than in middle-income nations, with Poland and Japan having a gap of over 60 percentage points.\n\nBut in middle-income nations, positive ratings are seen for both countries, leading to a smaller public opinion gap.\n\nThe United States gets the lowest ratings in Hungary, where 44 percent hold a favorable view, compared with 55 percent in 2022.\n\nThe survey found that “a majority or plurality has favorable views of the United States but not China” in nine countries, such as Poland and Japan, where 63 percent hold a positive view of the United States but a negative view of China.\n\nMost respondents said the United States interferes in other countries’ affairs but contributes to peace and stability worldwide. In Japan, 79 percent said the United States contributes a “fair amount” to global stability, while only 14 percent have the same view as China. Only respondents in Hungary consider that China contributes to world peace more than the United States.\n\nAmericans’ Views on ChinaIn May, another survey by the Pew Research Center found that over eight in ten Americans (83 percent) had unfavorable views of China, and the number of people who saw communist China as an enemy surged as the tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated in recent years.\n\nAmong 83 percent of Americans with unfavorable views of China, 44 percent said they had very negative views about China.\n\nAround three-quarters of Americans (77 percent) had little or no confidence in Mr. Xi.\n\nA rising number of Americans (38 percent) viewed China as an enemy compared to 25 percent in the January 2022 survey.\n\nAbout half of American adults (52 percent) viewed China as a competitor, while only 6 percent considered it a partner.\n\nThe relationship between Washington and Beijing has deteriorated over the past few years. The two countries have clashed over various issues, such as Taiwan, trade, human rights, and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Beijing-Moscow relations were also a significant concern for Americans, particularly amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This issue concerned Americans more than any other issues in the U.S.-China relationship, including trade, Taiwan, or human rights.\n\nFollowing Mr. Xi’s meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during his Moscow visit in March, 62 percent of Americans see the China-Russia alliance as a severe problem for the United States.\n\nFor the Taiwan issue, poll respondents also see correlations between Russia’s treatment of Ukraine and the Chinese regime’s treatment of Taiwan, as many Americans hold much more favorable views of Taiwan (65 percent) than China (14 percent).",

Thanks to the endless bumbling of the Biden administration, Russia and China have been pushed into each other’s arms, and now they seem determined to confront the western powers together. For those of you that have not been paying attention, the apocalyptic alliances that we have been anticipating for years have now formed. It is going to be the U.S. and Europe on one side, and Russia and China will be on the other.

He didn’t inherit an economic catastrophe. He inherited an economy that was growing above six percent. He inherited an economic boom. So, everything since then has been a lie.”\n\n“We got inflation because they lied that we were in an economic catastrophe, so they overspent,” he continued. “So, of course, right now you’re thinking, ‘Why can’t I make sense of this?’ It’s because it’s just lies.”\n\nCarney then zeroed in on Biden’s “middle out and bottom up” claim.\n\n“Nobody I’ve talked to can explain what ‘from the bottom up and the middle out’ means at all,” he said. “And that’s also not what they’re doing. When they are having government-directed money flowing into the economy—you know, all the subsidies for the Green New Deal stuff—that’s not from the bottom up. That’s the top down.”\n\n“It’s a grift,” Kudlow added. “It’s money to donors, campaign donors. It’s money to big corporations who buy into their DEI and climate change stuff. It’s money to Democratic interest groups city by city, state by state. You are so right. It’s totally top down.”\n\n“It’s not working either, because the American people are rejecting it all of the time. Whenever you see polls, they say they don’t trust Biden,” Carney noted.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans believe Biden’s economy is “poor,” and 64 percent disapprove of his management of the economy.\n\nCarney also commented on Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department, noting that despite the numbers coming in under expectations, the report “almost guarantees two more hikes” from the Federal Reserve.\n\nHe made this same point in Friday’s Breitbart Business Digest, explaining that the June jobs report and data showing a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly wages “are likely enough to lock-in a rate hike at the end-of-the-month Federal Open Market Committee meeting and tilt the balance in favor of another rate hike in September.”\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",

        "content": "The bottom-up Brussels green revolution \n\n A Belgian region’s environmental and social conditions for research funding offer a possible model for the EU.\n\nBy Anthony King\n\nIn the EU and Belgian capital Brussels, Barbara Trachte reflects the strengths of a third governmental layer in Europe: its numerous regions.\n\nTrachte is secretary of state of the Brussels-Capital Region responsible for the economic transition and scientific research. The first member of Belgium’s French-speaking Green party to be put in charge of an economic portfolio, she shows the scope for bottom-up EU policy changes.\n\nSetting an example\n\nTrachte helped put in place a Brussels law that, starting in 2024, has made regional subsidies for research organisations, companies, public administrations and civil society conditional on respect for social and environmental standards. She believes the EU should do the same for its €95.5 billion research programme known as Horizon Europe.\n\n‘Sometimes you need a revolution – or at least a mini revolution,’ Trachte told Horizon Magazine.\n\nShe said that Europe’s regions have a key role to play in advancing the continent’s transition to a net-zero economy.\n\nWith the EU seeking to become climate neutral by 2050 under the European Green Deal, Horizon Europe has placed increasing emphasis on projects to hasten the switch towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels and to ensure the process is socially fair.\n\nAlready the third-biggest part of the EU budget, Horizon Europe would have even greater impact on green and social matters across the continent by following the example set by the Brussels-Capital Region.\n\nIn a nutshell, €50 million of subsidies granted annually by the region for research and innovation require recipients to respect a do-no-harm principle and have a positive impact on the environment or social equality, according to Stephanie Lepczynski, who is Trachte’s policy adviser.\n\n‘We are showing the way and we hope that this can influence the European Commission by encouraging it to put environmental, social and governance criteria into the eligibility of Horizon projects,’ Lepczynski said at the European Research and Innovation Days event in Brussels on 20-21 March 2024.\n\nSecrets to success\n\nGender and transborder-cooperation requirements currently in place for EU funding help ensure greater diversity in research teams and produce scientific results that better reflect the make-up of society, according to Lepczynski.\n\nShe said that social and environmental conditionality in Horizon Europe would force researchers systematically to check that they’re acting for the common good and help ensure that funding advances EU green and social goals.\n\nTrachte said such conditions will also be merited in the successor programme of Horizon Europe, which runs for seven years through 2027.\n\n‘I wish for the next EU framework programme to decide the same – to have a greater impact and make a bigger contribution to the objectives of the European Green Deal,’ she said.\n\nFor Trachte, EU projects can have the most impact where academic, industry, government, civil society and the environment interact.\n\nThis is known as the “quintuple helix” approach to innovation. It has led governments increasingly to prioritise public involvement in innovation processes.\n\n‘This ensures that research is rooted in society and geared towards finding solutions to today’s major societal challenges such as climate degradation, growing socio-economic inequalities or democracies,’ Trachte said.\n\nMission driven\n\nShe singled out as particularly important the five Horizon Europe “Missions”: adapting to climate change, fighting cancer, restoring oceans, cleaning up soil and establishing 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030.\n\n‘The five Missions are a very innovative tool to make the societal challenges stand out – in particular the triple crisis of climate, biodiversity and pollution and the health challenges related to it,’ Trachte said.\n\nIn Brussels, the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission was notably successful in bringing together regional and local administrations as well as other partners from the private sector.\n\n‘The enthusiasm created behind the Missions has mobilised many different actors,’ Trachte said.\n\nThe views of the interviewees don’t necessarily reflect those of the European Commission.\n\nThis article was originally published in Horizon the EU Research and Innovation Magazine.",

However, it can be possible only after Moscow achieves its goals.\n\n\"An opportunity to resolve the conflict will appear only when Ukraine ceases to pose a threat to Russia and discriminate against Russian-speaking Ukrainians,” Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's Ambassador to the UN Security Council, said at a briefing at the UN Security Council.\n\n\"If this result can be achieved through negotiations, we are ready for such a scenario. If not, then our objectives will be achieved by military means,\" he added.\n\nRussia is not fighting against the Ukrainian people.

It gets money, weapons and intelligence data. Ukraine receives instructions which targets to attack and where. It is the Ukrainian people who suffer from this in the first place and the people of Ukraine are forced to fight for the sake of someone else's tasks.\"\n\nHowever, the Russian Ambassador to the UN said, everything could have ended differently for Ukraine, if Kyiv had implemented the now-defunct Minsk Agreements that were signed in 2014 and 2015 \"in an attempt to pave the way for peace by granting the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics a special status as part of the Ukrainian state\".\n\nFormer Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and ex-president of France Francois Hollande later confirmed that neither sitting President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, nor his predecessors, nor France and Germany, who were involved in the Minks Agreements process, never intended to fulfil them. This diplomatic process served only as a \"smoke screen\" behind which they secretly armed Ukraine against Russia.\n\nMerkel's and Hollande's confessions caused an uproar in Moscow. Russian officials called them a formalisation of betrayal. Interestingly, though, no one in the West was embarrassed about those statements. It appears that the West continues implementing its strategy.\n\nIn December, Ukraine put forward the idea of the Global Peace Summit based on Zelensky's \"peace formula.\" In that formula, among other things, Zelensky demanded Russia should withdraw its troops from all Ukrainian territories.\n\nMoscow dismissed the plan as it ignored the new status of Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Kherson, Zaporozhye (Zaporizhzhia) regions and Crimea as part of Russia.\n\nNow Kyiv has a new \"idea\":\n\nThe Ukrainian administration wants to hold a \"peace summit\" at UN headquarters in New York on February 24 (one year anniversary since the start of the special operation), but without Moscow's participation.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy was planning to visit New York in February to address a high-level meeting of the 193-member General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUkraine would like the UN General Assembly to adopt two resolutions:\n\n\"Peace talks could start after the UN General Assembly passes the resolutions or after the proposed summit is held,\" Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova said.\n\nSubscribe to Pravda.Ru Telegram channel, Facebook, RSS!\n\nThe fighting in several directions in the Kursk region continues.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal claimed he had “no idea” what happened to the funds.\n\nPhilippot also pointed to a recent corruption scandal involving Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Nikolay Solsky, who is accused of illegally appropriating state land worth nearly €6.9 million ($7.4 million). “Yet another case of corruption in this country, which is one of the most corrupt on the planet!” the French politician remarked.\n\n“Every euro sent to Ukraine prolongs the war and therefore causes unnecessary deaths, impoverishes us here, and has a strong chance of enriching the corrupt!” he added, calling for the conflict to be resolved as soon as possible.\n\nUkraine has been plagued by widespread graft for years, and a 2015 Guardian article described it as “the most corrupt nation in Europe.” More recently, it ranked 104 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index.\n\nThe issue has taken center stage during the conflict with Russia, including in the Ukrainian military, which has been rocked by several graft scandals in recent months. This winter, Ukraine’s SBU, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, announced that it had uncovered a major embezzlement scheme in which Ukrainian officials and private contractors stole around $40 million earmarked for shell procurement.\n\nElsewhere, the Pentagon’s inspector general admitted that Washington had failed to properly track more than $1 billion in weapons sent to Ukraine, although this did not stop US officials from claiming that they believed the assistance to have reached its intended destination.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has for months been warning about the spillover of foreign weapons sent to Ukraine, cautioning that they are ending up in the hands of organized crime outside of the country.",

This decision could significantly increase the region’s defense strength, but it also puts Ukraine in a potentially vulnerable position.\n\nThe deployed troops include the 82nd air assault brigade from the strategic reserve of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, equipped with Marder and Stryker armored vehicles, as well as Challenger 2 tanks. Forbes emphasizes that the 82nd and 46th air assault brigades were the last major formations that The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was kept in reserve to respond to possible threats.\n\nWhile such a move could strengthen Ukraine’s defensive position in the Rabotino region in the short term, such large formations are not capable of sustaining combat operations indefinitely. It is emphasized that when these brigades need rest, repair and restoration, they will not be replaced by equally combat-ready and trained units.\n\n",

        "content": "Costa Rica’s Sea Turtle Decline Linked to Climate Change \n\n The effects of climate change are increasingly evident in various parts of the planet. In Costa Rica, the impact is apparent due to high temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, and now the decline in sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nExperts from the APM Terminals Turtle Conservation Program, which protects sea turtle eggs and releases hatchlings on the beach that spans from the mouth of the Moín river to the mouth of the Matina River, have determined that this year the number of hatchlings and turtle releases in Moín will reach 10,000. In contrast, in 2022, approximately 30,000 turtles were released.\n\nClimate change and its repercussions, such as rising sea levels, high sea temperatures, and shifts in migration and feeding patterns, are resulting in fewer hatchlings.\n\n“There’s a decrease in turtle births on all nesting beaches from the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia to southern Nicaragua. We are monitoring data related to conditions exacerbated by and associated with climate change, such as warm waters in the North Atlantic that produce less food, and hot beaches with temperatures exceeding 34° Celsius, leading to infertile nests,” said Didiher Chacón, a specialist in Marine Sciences and the director of the Latin American Sea Turtles Association.\n\nRisk factors\n\nClimate change presents challenges that threaten the development of fertile turtle eggs and the births of leatherback, green, and hawksbill turtles.\n\nFor instance, sea turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination. During incubation, the temperature determines whether the offspring will be male or female. Rising temperatures are producing more female turtles, thereby reducing the chances of reproduction.\n\nFurthermore, the rise in sea levels, due to glacier melting and the thermal expansion of the oceans, results in a loss of nesting and feeding habitats for sea turtles. Nesting beaches may erode or become submerged, limiting the available space for turtles to nest.\n\nMarine species rely on ocean currents and water temperatures for their migrations. Climate change can disrupt these patterns, affecting the availability of food and altering the migration routes of sea turtles.\n\nMoreover, climate change can influence the availability and distribution of the turtles’ prey. Fluctuations in water temperatures and ocean acidification can destabilize marine ecosystems, thereby impacting the quantity and quality of food sources for sea turtles.\n\nDidiher Chacón emphasized that people can help the cause through actions such as abstaining from consuming turtle eggs, participating in volunteer programs aimed at nest protection, cleaning beaches, minimizing their greenhouse gas emissions, recycling to curtail the demand for plastics, and educating the younger generations about these measures.",

According to James, officials at JBS are \"misleading the public\" about the environmental impact of the company's operations.\n\nJBS says it will \"achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040\" while still implementing plans to \"increase production.\" In James' view, this means that JBS will increase its carbon footprint over the next 16 years.\n\n\"As families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis, they are willing to spend more of their hard-earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment,\" James commented about the case.\n\n\"When companies falsely advertise their commitment to sustainability, they are misleading consumers and endangering our planet.\"\n\nAccording to James, JBS is engaging in \"greenwashing\" tactics with its net zero claims. In her opinion, JBS is exploiting the pocketbooks of everyday Americans with a false promise of \"a healthy planet for future generations.\"\n\nJames reassured the public that her office \"will always ensure that companies do not abuse the environment and the trust of hardworking consumers for profit.\"\n\n(Related: Last year, Letitia James launched a state-approved terror campaign against Christians in New York.)\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

Does James have financial ties to the synthetic meat industry?\n\n\"Until now, growth factors had to be added to the surrounding liquid, or media,\" reported SciTechDaily about how bovine muscle cells can now produce their own growth factors thanks to technological developments from David Kaplan, a professor at the Tufts University Center for Cellular Agriculture (TUCCA).\n\n\"Made from recombinant (genetically engineered) protein and sold by industrial suppliers, growth factors contribute to a majority of the cost of production for cultivated meat (up to or above 90%). Since the growth factors don’t last long in the cell culture media, they also have to be replenished every few days. This limits the ability to provide an affordable product to consumers. Taking that ingredient out of the growth media leads to an enormous cost savings.\"\n\nIn other words, the real beef industry is being attacked on all sides with mysterious fires and lawsuits while the emerging synthetic beef industry is making major strides in reducing production costs. Can you say conspiracy?\n\n\"It just so happens as a matter of splendid serendipity that billionaire-funded lab-meat startups ramping up production coincides with the forced elimination via legal fiat of actual beef production by their minions who control DA offices from coast to coast,\" is how independent journalist Ben Bartee put it.\n\nIn the comments, someone wrote that this is clearly not a coincidence as \"their plans,\" referring to the powers that be, \"should be plain as the nose on a normie's face ... Operative words: should be.\"\n\n\"Franken-farming, AI drone-operated farmerless farms, synthetic food, and the 'China Model,'\" wrote another about the takeover of food by evil, also citing this article by researcher Sandi Adams.\n\nIf the climate really is changing, it is because of all the green nonsense like synthetic, lab-grown \"meat.\" Learn more at Climate.news.\n\nSources for this article include:",

Period full stop. That was a single, clear sentence. It’s not subject to negotiation from any country, including Russia.",

Medvedev was reacting to the imminent signing of a security agreement between London and Kiev.\n\nMedvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, issued his warning in a social media post.\n\nA visit to Kiev on Friday by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is set to sign a security agreement with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, would ensure British troops would be openly deployed to Ukraine.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nSunak’s arrival in the Ukrainian capital is meant to “set out a major new package of support and reaffirm the close UK-Ukraine partnership,” his office said in a statement. The security document is a follow-up to agreements reached by G7 and NATO members last year, it noted. The statement did not mention any plans for a British military deployment in Ukraine, however, it could be implied.\n\n“[The deal] formalizes a range of support the UK has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defense industrial cooperation,” Downing Street said, according to a report by RT.\n\nThe British government has pledged £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) in military aid to Ukraine over the next two years, including in the form of thousands of military drones, which London said will be the largest of their kind ever received by Kiev.

The most populous US state has been pummeled by near-record downpours over a very wet three weeks, which have already caused flooding, landslides and widespread power outages. At least 19 people are known to have died as communities struggle to cope with the constant deluge.\n\nOn Friday yet another system moved in, with forecasters warning the Monterey Peninsula could be cut off and the whole city of Salinas-home to 160,000 people-flooded. \"The entire lower Salinas Valley will have disastrous flooding,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"The entire city of Salinas is in danger of flooding. Most of Castroville will flood. All roads near the Salinas River will be flooded and impassable. 90,000 acres or more of agricultural land in the Salinas Valley will have disastrous flooding. \"Many roads, homes and agricultural land areas in the Salinas Valley will have major flood damage.\" The Salinas River, already swollen by weeks of torrential rain, was expected to peak some time Friday, breaching its banks in a flood that could last until Sunday.\n\nKelley O'Connell said the bursting of a levee near her home had worried her. \"If they release water from the dams or we get more rain, we're just a field away,\" she told the San Francisco Chronicle as she collected sandbags.\n\nEvacuation orders and warnings were widespread, with forecasters saying major roads could become impassable-including highways that link the Monterey Peninsula with the rest of the county. \"Residents both on the peninsula and in the Salinas area should expect to be cut off for two to three days,\" Monterey County officials said earlier this week.\n\nMonterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto told reporters Thursday that floodwater could strand people. \"This is a slow-moving event\" and not all places will be impacted at once, she said. \"The river crests at different times.\"\n\nResident John Guru said he was taking no chances, with four days' supplies at home and two days' worth in his car in case he is caught out on the road. \"I'm not sure how bad it's going to be,\" he told the Monterey Herald. \"I will find a place if needed and do whatever it takes,\" he said, adding: \"This is crazy, I was not anticipating anything like this.\"\n\nSnow\n\nWorkers have rushed out in between storms to clear up some of the mess left behind, shoveling mud from roads even in the heart of Los Angeles. Crews have cut up felled trees, and heavy machinery have been drafted in to move rockslides.\n\nHundreds of thousands of homes and businesses have been left without power at various times-sometimes repeatedly-as rickety infrastructure has taken a battering. And it's not over yet, forecasters say. \"The ongoing unsettled weather in the West associated with the active Atmospheric River pattern unfortunately continues into this weekend with another couple rounds of heavy precipitation forecast,\" the NWS said.\n\nOver the mountains, that precipitation was falling as snow, with more than three feet (a meter) expected in the Sierra Nevada range, making travel dangerous or impossible, even as thousands of skiers and snowboarders head for fresh powder over the Martin Luther King, Jr Day holiday weekend.\n\nAmong those who have died in the last three weeks were drivers who were found in submerged cars, people struck by falling trees, a husband and wife killed in a rockfall, and people whose bodies were discovered in floodwaters. Winter storms are not unusual in California, where most of the annual rain comes in a fairly concentrated period.\n\nBut global warming, driven by the industrial era's unchecked use of fossil fuels, is supercharging storms, making them wetter and wilder. At the same time, the western United States is aridifying, with much of the region in its 23rd year of drought. Hydrologists say the recent rains are helping-California has received an average of almost nine inches (23 centimeters) of rain since late December-but are not a fix. \"A few weeks of storms is not enough in this drought for California, but it certainly is nice. It's certainly making a good dent,\" Jay Lund, director of University of California, Davis, told the Chronicle. ",

        "content": "If they are willing to poison the chickens to stop them from laying eggs, they are likely poisoning the HUMAN food supply to stop us from having children \n\n A few globalist-owned and controlled animal feed companies are supplying farmers with tainted chicken feed that allegedly prevent hens from producing eggs, adding to the chaotic food shortages and supply chain breakdowns. Is this another attempt to cripple the entire food supply, including meat and eggs, so everyone will run to the grocery stores and buy genetically-mutated, lab-concocted Franken-meat that Bill Gates funds? It would appear so.\n\nNot only are hens unable to lay eggs for months after consuming globalist-manufactured tainted feed, but could it be possible those chickens and eggs are also toxic for humans to consume, possibly causing infertility issues for them also? Local egg suppliers and farmers are blowing the whistle on what could be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corporations purposely trying to cripple the meat and egg supplies of this country, driving inflation through the roof.\n\nEver since October, several American egg farmers have experienced ZERO egg production from their chickens, until they switched their feed to a different kind, some even going with goat feed. Now, suddenly, the chickens are laying eggs again, almost back to the normal rate. What is the explanation? Chickens do produce fewer eggs in the winter due to the shorter daylight hours and molting (shedding of feathers), but they don't usually completely stop laying.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

What companies are the farmers pointing the finger at?\n\nPurina's Dumor brand and Tractor Supply's Producer's Pride brand of chicken feed. These are the culprits, and if you follow the money up the line, it leads straight to the corporate gurus and globalists who are urging all humans to stop eating meat and eggs, and start eating grub worms and cockroaches, in order to save the planet from… global warming. Sure. Meanwhile, at the Davos convention, the globalists are all eating salmon and steaks. So, you were saying?\n\nIt's now more than obvious there is a deliberate war on food being waged against civilians by the globalists. Centralized suppliers, especially those that supply rural farmers that are mostly Conservatives and Republicans, are obviously out to cripple the egg supply, as strong evidence comes from two particular brands of feed these farmers use regularly.\n\nThis tragedy is forcing people to connect the dots and realize that it's not just the hen food that's causing production and infertility problems, but the human food as well. Egg farmers are now on the record saying, “If they are willing to poison my chickens to prevent me from supplying myself or others with eggs, then surely they would poison the food I eat and feed my family.”\n\nThere is a massive public awakening happening now, as food prices soar and supplies get choked out. More people are dying right and left from \"unknown causes\" and it's getting worse by the day. People are dropping dead from heart attacks and strokes and many fewer humans have been having babies over the past few years, since the scamdemic began. Coincidence? It's population reduction, and it's a war being waged using food, medicine, viruses, dirty vaccines, and supply chain dismantling.\n\nTune your food news frequency to FoodSupply.news and get updates on more toxic foods and food shortages coming soon to stores near you.\n",

        "content": "Vantage | Every day of war and their stock goes up, pockets bulge \n\n We talked about the players, we talked about the stakeholders, we talked about the politics. Now, let’s talk about the benefits. We know it sounds like a paradox. This is, after all, a war so who can possibly benefit? The defence industry.\n\nWars can lead to an increase in defence spending. The more prolonged and intense the conflict, the greater the demand. A government that is fighting a war will obviously spend more money. So, nations invest heavily in technology, in weaponry, and in infrastructure.\n\nThis heightened demand helps defence companies across the globe, and that causes stocks to rally. Take U.S. defence stocks for example. They have added $23 billion in market value since the war began. On Monday, Northrop Grumman soared by 12%, General Dynamics jumped 9%, Lockheed Martin gained 8% and RTX rallied 4%, and this is only expected to grow in the days ahead.\n\nTake Lockheed Martin, for example. This company makes the F-35 fighter jets being used by the Israel military. They also make Black Hawk helicopters. Northrop Grumman makes combat vehicles. Israel uses all these weapons and will need more in the future. The U.S. will be sending more weapons to Israel in the coming days, so the stocks of these companies are expected to rally.\n\nAnd this won’t be the first time this happens. Last year too, defence stocks got a huge boost when Russia invaded Ukraine. As of today, the US has spent over $40 billion in military aid to Ukraine, so the biggest beneficiary is the American defence sector and that is likely to be the case with this war too.\n\nThis is one of the harshest realities of war. For some people, wars cost lives and for others, they drive value. For defence companies wars act as economic stimulus, they bolster sales, they fuel job creation and sometimes they also boost local economies.\n\nNow, of course, this does raise moral and ethical questions like: is this profiting from human suffering? More importantly: is this motivation to prolong a conflict? Plus, there is the investor dilemma: defence stocks are often called sin stocks, or warmonger investments.\n\nBut the label here doesn’t matter, these stocks surge massively during war and that makes them very attractive for investors. Currently, the world is dealing with two wars - the Ukraine war, and now, the Israel-Hamas war. Defence spending was already on the rise this year. Europe has ramped up military sending, the highest since the cold war. Asian nations have also bumped spending. Defence budgets of Japan and South Korea grew by 7% in 2022, India’s defence budget was $81.4 billion in 2022, a rise of 6% from 2021.\n\nCurrently, global military spending is at $2.24 trillion, which is 2.2% of the world’s GDP. Chances are it will only rise further in the coming days.\n",

Many of these activist hubs are being bankrolled by Climate Emergency Fund, a Beverly Hills-based charity linked to Hollywood celebrities and top liberal nonprofit organizations aiming to shape the Democratic Party’s agenda, according to tax forms and other documents reviewed by the Washington Examiner.\n\n“Climate Emergency Fund has quickly become the ATM that radical environmental activists turn to fund their latest disruptions,” Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the conservative watchdog Americans for Public Trust, told the Washington Examiner. “And as their destruction increases, so should the scrutiny on who is bankrolling the Climate Emergency Fund and their ties to more mainstream environmental groups that might disagree with these over-the-top and dangerous tactics.”…\n\nAnd, unlike the typical run-of-the-mill charity, CEF boasts a star-studded cohort of financial backers and board members, including Rory Kennedy, daughter of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy, Aileen Getty, the billionaire philanthropist and heiress of the Getty family fortune earned in the petroleum industry, and even Hollywood’s Adam McKay, who pledged it $4 million in September 2022 and directed the 2021 climate allegory film Don’t Look Up.\n\nCEF celebrity funders also include Jeremy Strong, who plays Kendall Roy in the HBO TV series Succession, comedian Chelsea Handler, actor and Silicon Valley star Thomas Middleditch, and Abigail Disney, daughter of ex-Disney executive Roy E.

He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. \n\nAlsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020.

This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday morning following Russia’s announcement.\n\nRussia did not say how many units were being withdrawn, and how far, after a build-up of some 130,000 Russian troops to the north, east, and south of Ukraine. Video footage posted online by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday allegedly showed Russian tanks moving back to their permanent bases and away from the border.\n\nNATO said that it has yet to see evidence of a de-escalation in the crisis.\n\n“Russia has amassed a fighting force in and around Ukraine unprecedented since the cold war. Everything is now in place for a new attack,” Stoltenberg said. “But Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution.”\n\nThe Kremlin said Tuesday’s developments were proof that Western talk of war had been both false and hysterical.\n\n“February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement, according to Reuters.\n\nOn Monday, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russian media the United States and the West are trying to “spark a conflict” with recent statements about a possible invasion.\n\n“Look, if we planned any war against Ukraine, the media would have behaved completely differently. Because the media is the modern war’s bombardments,” he said.\n\nFrance said it had yet to confirm the return of some Russian troops to bases, though this would be a positive sign. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the latest Western diplomatic mission to defuse the crisis, met Putin in the Kremlin.\n\nOver the past weekend and on Monday, White House officials called on Americans to leave Ukraine and asserted that an invasion could occur in the near future. No evidence was provided for the second claim.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State also shut down its embassy in Kyiv and moved it to Lviv, located in the western part of Ukraine.\n\n“We are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kyiv to Lviv due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\n“These prudent precautions in no way undermine our support for or our commitment to Ukraine. Our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering,” Blinken added, noting that “the path for diplomacy” is available.\n\nAround the same time, confusion was sparked when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a statement on Facebook that said Russia would invade on Feb. 16. However, his office later said that he made the remarks sarcastically in an apparent attempt to make light of various Western intelligence reports suggesting an imminent invasion.",

A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two candidates in a statistical tie with registered voters.\n\nTrump opened his remarks in Dayton with a tribute to his supporters who are currently in jail for rioting at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as they sought to block certification of Biden's 2020 election win.\n\nTrump saluted and called them \"patriots\" and \"hostages\".\n\nThe former Republican president has been using increasingly dystopian rhetoric in his campaign speeches about the state of the country.\n\nIn the middle of a section in his speech about placing tariffs on imported cars, and foreign competition for the US auto industry, Trump declared: \"If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole country.\"\n\nAsked what he meant, his campaign pointed to a post on the social media platform X by a New York Times journalist, which said Trump's \"bloodbath\" comment came amid a discussion about the US auto industry and the economy.\n\nAsked for a response to Trump's \"bloodbath\" comment, Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer condemned Trump's \"extremism\", \"his thirst for revenge\", and his \"threats of political violence\".\n\nTrump also appealed to Blacks and Hispanics, voters who will play a key role in deciding November's election.\n\nTrump has been narrowing the gap with Biden in opinion polls with non-white voters, who formed a core part of Biden's winning coalition when he defeated Trump in 2020.\n\nTrump cited a central campaign theme, that too many illegal immigrants have crossed the US-Mexico border since Biden took office, in his appeal to minority voters.\n\n\"No-one has been hurt by Joe Biden's migrant invasion more than our great African American and Hispanic communities,\" Trump said. He claimed without citing any evidence that illegal immigrants were taking their jobs.",

        "content": "Biden regime's war on your appliances just widened with new attack on dishwashers, under guise of 'climate change' \n\n Under the guise of 'fighting climate change,' the regime has now proposed new regulations that target some of the most commonly used household appliances, including dishwashers. According to Fox Business, the Department of Energy has proposed new rules that would reduce the current limits for water and energy use in dishwashers.\n\nThe proposed rules would limit dishwashers to using 3.2 gallons of water per cycle, significantly lower than the current limit of 5 gallons, and manufacturers would need to reduce their products’ energy consumption by almost 30 percent. Even though most dishwashers available on the market already meet or exceed the current federal standards, the proposed rules have left some questioning why the Biden administration is focusing on such regulations rather than other priorities.\n\n“Dishwashers are not the only appliances Biden’s DOE has set its sights on, however, as the regulator is also considering crackdowns on washers, dryers and refrigerators that manufacturers say could reduce performance,” Fox Business noted further.\n\nMembers of the regime have been clear: The rule changes pertain to Biden’s ‘climate agenda.’\n\n“Collectively these energy efficiency actions … support President Biden’s ambitious clean energy agenda to combat the climate crisis,” the DOE wrote earlier this year.\n\n“This Administration is using all of the tools at our disposal to save Americans money while promoting innovations that will reduce carbon pollution and combat the climate crisis,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stated in a Friday news release.\n\nCritics have also poked major holes in the regime's claim that the new rules are going to save American consumers oodles of money each year.\n\n“The department estimates that consumers will save $3 billion over the next 30 years, or $100 million per year, on their utility bills thanks to the rougher rules,” Christian Britschgi wrote at Reason. “That’s a pretty small per capita savings when spread across the 89 million dishwasher-owning households.”\n\nIn fact, he noted that the new rules actually might lead to more water use:\n\nThe new regulations might lead to more water usage as individuals switch to washing dishes by hand, Britschgi pointed out, citing research from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).\n\nThe think tank’s proposal led President Donald Trump’s administration to approve a new class of dishwashers that clean dishes in one hour, though Biden’s team repealed the pro-consumer regulatory agenda of his predecessor.\n\nThe proposed dishwasher regulations follow a recent debate over gas stoves at the national level. Despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s reassurances that there is nothing to be concerned about, just last week his home state of New York prohibited gas stoves.\n\n“Nobody is taking away your gas stove,” Schumer tweeted in early February. “Shameless and desperate MAGA Republicans are showing us they will cook up any distraction to divert from real issues the American people want solved, like the debt ceiling.”\n\nThat turned out to be 100 percent false, obviously.\n\n“Nevertheless, New York lawmakers agreed to ban gas stove hookups in all future buildings in late April. The ban will affect new construction on small buildings in 2025 and move on to larger buildings by 2028,” Fox Business added.\n\nIn a statement last month, Consumer Product Safety Commission Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr., a Democratic activist and labor union leader, suggested that stoves could pose a “hidden hazard” to users and that \"any option is on the table.\" However, after receiving backlash, Chairman Alex Hoehn-Saric clarified that the agency had no plans to ban stoves.\n\nBut in February, the Energy Department went ahead with a new proposal that would allow government regulators to write energy consumption standards for the appliances, the Daily Wire reported.\n\nSources include:",

        "content": "The electric vehicle (EV) house of cards is COLLAPSING: “honeymoon is over … don’t expect the marriage itself to last much longer either” \n\n You see, the EV scam was hastily hatched by far-leftists who are so detached from reality that they actually believe it is possible to just stop using earth-based fossil fuels on some arbitrary timeline with nothing viable to replace them.\n\nNot only that, but \"green\" enthusiasts seem to lack the cognition necessary to see that there is no workable infrastructure in place to even accommodate the use of EVs as a total replacement for cars with internal combustion engines.\n\n\"The mass conversion from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs) to electric vehicles was never more than a Democrat / environmentalist hallucination anyway,\" says Dr. Ron Ross, PhD.\n\n\"It was the most ill-conceived government policy objective in modern history. The transition should have been a nonstarter. It's riddled with numerous deal killers. It's like having a dozen fatal diseases all at the same time.\"\n\n(Related: Learn more about why EVs have been a scam from the very beginning.)\n\nIn a piece he wrote for the Climate Change Dispatch that was also picked up by Climate Depot, Ross explains at great length what would need to be in place just to create the possibility that a nationwide fleet of 100 percent EVs would work.\n\nFor one, energy generation and grid expansion would need to at least double, and very quickly. With the arbitrary deadlines the greenies have put in place, one of the big ones being Agenda 2030, that type of rapid expansion is simply impossible.\n\nThere is a reason why there was never any market research or feasibility studies done on the EV transition. Had they been, the results would have shown what we are now all finding out in real time: that EVs are a lost cause.\n\n\"The electric vehicle honeymoon is over,\" Ross contends. \"Don't expect the marriage itself to last much longer either.\"\n\nAnother thing the greenies never considered is the lengthy charging times for EVs. While a gas-powered vehicle can be refilled with gas at any one of the tens of thousands of gas stations that dot the United States landscape, EVs take hours to charge – assuming you can even find a charger.\n\nSomeone with an EV who lives in California, for instance, would not even make it through Arizona, let alone all the way through Texas, if they were, say, taking a road trip to Florida.\n\n\"Did they truly believe everyone would tolerate spending hours to charge their vehicles rather than the minutes they were accustomed to?\" Ross asks.\n\nSales data clearly shows that the American public is simply not interested, either due to cost or impracticality, in buying an EV. Heck, even car rental companies are having trouble getting their customers to rent an EV for a day or two, let alone buy one.\n\nEven so, car manufacturers are continuing to ramp up EV production. This means that, in time, there will be EV graveyards full of unsold EVs, resulting in untold billions of dollars in losses and serious economic repercussions.\n\n\"We are spending trillions on a fabricated dream, all for imaginary payoffs decades in the future,\" Ross writes.\n\n\"When the EV house of cards collapses what will the reaction be? Ordinarily, for normal persons, it should be a time for regret, rethinking, and humility ... It would be good if the Democrat / environmentalist true believers learned something from the EV debacle.\"\n",

        "content": "The World Needs Peacemaker Trump Again \n\n by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\n\nThe world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\n\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\n\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\n\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\n\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\n\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\n\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\n\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\n\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\n\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”\n\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”\n\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\n\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\n\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\n\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com",

        "content": "How Nikita Khrushchev Exposed the Hypocrisy of US Interventions \n\n For American interventionists living today, all that one needs to know is that Russia invaded Ukraine. End of story. Black and white. Russia bad. Ukraine good. Support Ukraine with U.S. taxpayer-funded cash and armaments. America good.\n\nIf we go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, we find that things are not so simple, especially for American interventionists, even if they don’t realize it.\nThe Soviets had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba that had the capability of hitting U.S. cities along the Eastern seaboard, including Washington, D.C., and New York City. The crisis lasted from October 16 through October 29, 1962.\n\nPresident Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove their nuclear missiles from Cuba and take them back to the Soviet Union. The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites, followed by a full-scale regime-change military invasion of the island. In other words, they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine. In fact, the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother, secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin “If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.”\n\nOn October 27 — two days before the crisis was resolved — Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote a letter to Kennedy stating the following:\nBut how are we, the Soviet Union, our Government, to assess your actions, which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases; surrounded our allies with military bases; placed military bases literally around our country; and stationed your missile armaments there? This is no secret. Responsible American personages openly declare that it is so. Your missiles are located in Britain, are located in Italy, and are aimed against us. Your missiles are located in Turkey.\n\nYou are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But Turkey adjoins us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other. Do you consider, then, that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive, but do not accord the same right to us? You have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Turkey, literally next to us. How then can recognition of our equal military capacities be reconciled with such unequal relations between our great states? This is irreconcilable.\n\nDo you see the problem? Khrushchev was pointing out the hypocrisy of the U.S. position, a position that American interventionists today simply cannot recognize, owing to their blind allegiance to the U.S. national-security establishment.\n\nThe fact is that the Soviets had the legal authority to place their nuclear missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to join NATO. Cuba, like Ukraine, is a sovereign, independent country and, therefore, had the legal authority to permit the Soviets to install their missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to permit the U.S. and NATO to install their nuclear missiles in Ukraine.\n\nBut even though such legal authority exists, no one, including both Russians and Americans, likes to have nuclear missiles pointed at himself, especially from just a few miles away. This is the point that Kennedy was making when he stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA, he was willing to risk all-out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles, even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install them in Cuba. He, the Pentagon, and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States.\n\nBut that’s precisely how the Soviets felt as well, which is what Khrushchev was expressing in his letter to Kennedy. He was essentially saying, “Hey, you don’t like our missiles in Cuba because they are so close to your country. That’s exactly how we feel as well, not only about your missiles over here that are painted at us but also about all your military bases with which you have surrounded us. How come you can’t understand that?”\n\nWell, Kennedy did come to understand that. That’s how he and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal, one that infuriated the U.S. national-security establishment as well as American interventionists.\nThe deal consisted of two major parts: First, Kennedy vowed that he would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and, second, Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff were livid. They considered Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history. They compared his actions during the crisis to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler at Munich.\n\nFor their part, American interventionists were also furious over Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis. As far as they were concerned, the Pentagon and the CIA had the “right” to install their nuclear missiles wherever they want and the Soviets did not have the “right” to do the same. It’s a position that American interventionists still hold today.\n\nCan you see why American interventionists hated Kennedy so much and why the Pentagon and the CIA ultimately concluded that he constituted a grave threat to “national security”?\n",

Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.\n\nHe described advancing plans for \"the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.\"\n\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more \"weapons right now\"--describing that \"Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.\"\n\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as \"the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.\"\n\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the \"bad news\" of late out of Ukraine.\n\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be \"charity\" but is instead an \"investment\" in America's \"global leadership.\"\n\nHe further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. \"We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,\" Yermak said.\n\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:",

Many of those working disclosure are subject matter experts,. While disclosure to the Inquiry is a priority, there have been times when this has had to take second place behind live, ongoing issues of national security.”\n\nMcGahey testifed before Hughes at a two-hour hearing on the Novichok allegations in a London courtroom last Friday, November 11. Follow what was said, and what was meant, in this analysis. An official transcript of the hearing can be read here.\n\nAccording to McGahey, “approximately 80,000 documents (including emails) have been identified and located as relevant” to the Hughes inquiry. But before any of them can be identified, quoted, or released publicly, McGahey suggested, the government’s Ukraine warfighters will be obliged to down their weapons and pick up censorship tools to prevent the Russians from gaining any advantage.\n\nAs Hughes has announced, referring to the allegations of Novichok poisoning, “the responsibility for the events in Salisbury [Skripal incident March 4, 2018] and Amesbury [Sturgess incident June 30, 2018] is what is to be decided by this Inquiry. There is, however, at least a prima facie case (denied by those accused) that those responsible were Russian nationals acting in the interests of the Russian state and allegedly under its direction.”\n\nExactly what roles in the Ukraine war the “subject matter experts” are playing has not been disclosed. The Russian Government has publicly accused the British Government of providing undersea drone and other technology for attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Russia’s Black Sea fleet, a plan of attack against the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, and nuclear weapons design.\n\nMcGahey told Hughes the British Government hasn’t enough money to pay these warfighters to do both the Ukrainian and the Novichok jobs. “There are stretched resources and budgets across HMG [HHis Majesty’s Government], which are not trivial, and there is very real pressure on government departments and agencies.”\n\nHughes has decided there must be a near-total ban on identifying by name any British official engaged in warmaking against Russia, including intelligence gathering, weapons training, plans and operations.\n\n“The risk of damage to national security here,” he said, ” lies in the risk that hostile actors, whether State or otherwise and, if State, whether Russian or otherwise, might target individuals identified as concerned in the UK reaction to those events, and/or might use access to their names as a means of disrupting UK public functions. I am satisfied, on all the material I have seen, both OPEN and CLOSED, that these are marked real risks to some of those who were involved in the 2018 events, and that Russia in particular has both an interest in such activity and a known capacity to carry it out. For most of these persons therefore, a restriction order is likely to be necessary… [Russia] would have a similar interest in anyone amongst government staff who carried out any sensitive role; an obvious example would be any person concerned in the work of intelligence agencies, or other covert activities, but the risk will not be limited to them. General disclosure of the names of persons subject to these risks would indeed present a hostile actor with a convenient directory of suitable targets and/or a list of sensitive functions which would be of considerable value to a hostile actor accumulating intelligence about UK security and government systems.”\n\nLeave a Reply",

SEP/IYSSE public meeting in Sri Lanka \n\n The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Sri Lanka are holding an online meeting entitled “Oppose imperialist war!” on Thursday, May 23, at 7pm.\n\nIn announcing the recent International May Day Rally, David North, chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, warned, “A third world war is not a distant possibility. The opening stages of this war are already underway.”\n\nIsrael’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.\n\nThe imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.\n\nThe Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the “red lines” in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.\n\nOne might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.\n\nWar is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.\n\nOur comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.\n\nIn the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.\n\nThe ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.\n\nThe only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.\n\nA struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt. The independent mobilisation of workers on this basis needs to take up the fight to free Assange and Syrotiuk as well.\n\nThe burning need is for a new revolutionary leadership in the working class based on socialist internationalism to abolish the source of militarism, austerity, authoritarianism and all sorts of social misery—the capitalist system.\n\nWe invite you to participate in this important meeting. You can register for the online Zoom meeting using the link below.\n\nhttps://us04web.zoom.us/meeting/register/upYrfuGgrzovHdwsh0kw_cmGXQh_D1H27Gwi",

        "content": "Report: Russia Ramps Up Use of Chem Weapons in Ukraine \n\n U.S. and Ukrainian officials, as well as medics, soldiers, and international researchers, claim Russia is increasing its use of toxic gases on the battlefield is increasing as it escalates an offensive designed to seize more of Ukraine's territory than the roughly 20% it already occupies.\n\nLast month, Ukrainian soldiers were encamped in a front-line dugout and under siege from Russian drones dropping grenades, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Although there were no explosions when the first bombs landed, a strong smell of chlorine filled the air. The soldiers felt their skin sting, eyes water, and lungs fill with smoke, provoking a hard cough.\n\nThey placed rags soaked with water over their faces as the heavy gas filled the air. Oleksiy Bozhko, a volunteer medic whose team examined the men near the eastern city of Avdiivka, identified the gas as chloropicrin, a banned chemical irritant, based on the men's symptoms and descriptions of the smell, the Journal reported.\n\n\"This weapon cripples and kills, it's indiscriminate,\" Bozhko said.\n\nThe U.S. announced sanctions earlier this month against Russian companies and government bodies involved in the creation and supply of chemical weapons used at the front lines in Ukraine, singling out chloropicrin. The chemical agent, sometimes used in pesticides, was weaponized during World War I and is banned for use in battle by the Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Russia is a signatory.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions announcement, the Journal reported, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, called accusations that troops used toxic gases \"baseless,\" saying, \"Russia has been and remains committed to its obligations under international law in this area.\" The Kremlin and the Russian Defense Ministry didn't immediately respond to requests from the Journal for comment.\n\nDan Kaszeta, an expert on chemical weapons and associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, told the Journal chloropicrin is toxic to humans and animals, but also acts as an irritant.\n\nDepending on the level of exposure, the gas can burn skin, irritate tear ducts, and make it difficult to breathe, let alone defend against incoming attacks. Kaszeta told the Journal the chemical has been surpassed by more modern agents sometimes used by riot police as tear gas, known as CN and CS, which are also banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nCapt. Dmytro Serhiyenko, assistant to the commander of the Analytical Center of the Ukrainian Army's Support Forces, which analyzes chemical weapon use on the front lines, told the Journal all three of those agents are used by Russia on the battlefield. Although his team has mostly logged uses of CN and CS in the areas they track, they also found two grenades containing chloropicrin at abandoned Russian positions.\n\nUkrainians have been tracking the use of chemical weapons at the front since February 2023, the Journal reported, and the number of confirmed incidents has steadily increased. As of May 3, the Support Forces have confirmed 1,891 such attacks since they began tracking data, including 444 in April, an increase of 71 confirmed incidents from March. These numbers are incomplete because it isn't possible to get to the location where a gas was used to collect a sample or interview soldiers because of the intensity of the fighting.\n",

        "content": "Vantage | Is poisoning of Ukraine spy chief's wife part of old Russia playbook? \n\n As the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its grim second year, a new and ominous chapter has unfolded with the poisoning of Marianna Budanova, the wife of Ukraine’s spy chief, Kyrylo Budanov. This incident marks a disturbing turn in the ongoing hostilities between the two nations, raising questions about the methods employed and the potential infiltration of intelligence agencies.\n\nThe conflict has reached a virtual stalemate with both sides fortifying their positions as winter sets in. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s counteroffensive has stalled and Russia maintains its occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine. As the war approaches its two-year mark, tensions continue to escalate.\n\nF-16 factor\n\nThe focus now shifts to the military strategies employed by both sides. Ukraine is placing its hopes on the acquisition of F-16 fighter jets with expectations of receiving the first batch before the new year. Meanwhile, Russia appears to be resorting to covert tactics introducing the alarming element of poison into the conflict.\n\nThe use of poison, a notorious tool in Putin’s arsenal to silence critics, has now found its way to the Ukrainian battlefield. Marianna Budanova has become the first known target of this insidious method. Reports indicate that the Ukrainian intelligence unit G-U-R, responsible for the country’s security, has confirmed her poisoning along with several other officials, all now hospitalised.\n\nThe aftermath of Marianna Budanova’s poisoning raises serious questions about a potential breach in Ukraine’s intelligence unit. Accusations are being thrown between the two nations with Russia placing blame on Ukraine citing it as a case of infighting. This incident sheds light on the vulnerability of high-profile Ukrainian leaders and their families.\n\nKyrylo Budanov: A targeted spy chief\n\nKyrylo Budanov, a 37-year-old Lieutenant General and chief of Ukraine’s main spy agency since 2020, has been a thorn in Moscow’s side. Known for orchestrating attacks deep inside Russian territory, Budanov has survived at least 10 assassination attempts including a botched car bombing in 2019. His actions have made him a hate figure in Russia further escalating tensions.\n\nMoscow has levied charges against Budanov, linking his unit to the killings of pro-war Russian figures, including Vladlen Tatarsky, a blogger, and Darya Dugina, a journalist and the daughter of a close ally of Putin. These charges make Budanov a prime target for Russian agencies.\n\nHistory of covert poisoning in Russia\n\nThe use of poison as a weapon is not new in Russian tactics. Notable victims include Alexei Navalny, Putin’s vocal opposition politician currently serving a 30-year jail term, and the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London. The recurring theme of poisoning critics underscores the ruthless methods employed by Russian intelligence.\n\nThe poisoning of Marianna Budanova adds a sinister dimension to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As the war rages on, the international community watches with concern, grappling with the use of poison as a tool of war. The incident raises urgent questions about the safety of high-profile individuals and the potential infiltration of intelligence units, further complicating an already volatile situation.\n",

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss asserted, however, that Moscow must deescalate tensions and “end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy.”\n\nBut over the weekend, Russian officials said the UK’s Foreign Office should stop publishing “nonsense” and “disinformation.”\n\nThe embassy further alleged that the UK’s strategy is to accuse “Russia of plotting ‘inevitable’ invasion of Ukraine and try to play the role of an ideological leader, defending itself from ‘autocrats’ and aiming to ‘free the world.’”\n\nMurayev, meanwhile, responded to the UK’s statement by dismissing the claim.\n\nIn a message to Reuters, Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the presidential office, said the allegations should be taken seriously, acknowledged there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was “too ridiculous a figure” to be the Kremlin’s pick to lead Ukraine. But he added that Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held Donbass.\n\nTherefore “one should take this information as seriously as possible,” he said.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne appeared to endorse the UK assessment that the Kremlin is plotting to install a Moscow-friendly puppet administration.\n\n“This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,” Horne said. “The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine.”",

The Samarkand State Medical University in Uzbekistan welcomed over 1,000 Indian medical students who were evacuated from Ukraine after the Indian Embassy there inquired about the possibility of a transfer for the affected students.\n\nAmit, originally from Bihar’s Begusarai, experienced the Russian attack in Ukraine and spent one night in a basement. He was among the students evacuated by the Indian government through the ‘Operation Ganga’ initiative.\n\n‘Operation Ganga’ was launched by the Indian government to bring back Indians stranded in Ukraine, resulting in the successful evacuation of a total of 18,282 Indian nationals under the initiative.\n\n“I thought I wouldn’t make it and would either die or will be stranded in Ukraine. Once I was back home in India, me and my family were relieved but then began the never-ending cycle of uncertainty about what was next. I had finished three years of my MBBS in Ukraine and to start all over again or pursue something else was not an option I wanted to consider. I later decided to move to Uzbekistan,” Amit told PTI.\n\nHe says living expenses in Samarkand are higher than that of Ukraine but he is happy to be able to continue his education.\n\nTanwi Wadhva from Punjab’s Ferozepur, who was studying at Bukovinian State Medical University in Ukraine, was apprehensive about joining the university due to the loss of a semester.\n\n“I attended online classes for eight months. We were hopeful that the war would end and we would go back. Some students even went back from different routes but I didn’t want to take that risk. I evaluated all options from Georgia to Poland and decided to come to Uzbekistan. The university admitted us a semester back, I was initially apprehensive about the loss of one semester but later I changed my mind and it was worth the decision,” she said.\n\nDivyansh from Meerut who used to study at the same university as Wadhwa said Uzbekistan’s universities offered teaching and learning in English and the curriculum was on the same lines.\n\n“Not all countries have universities which offer English as a medium of instruction. So that was a very important factor. Quality of life is similar in Ukraine and Samarkand but this place feels safer now,” he said.\n\nAround 19,000 Indian students were studying in Ukraine when the Russian invasion began in February 2021.\n\nAccording to estimates, approximately 2,000 Indian students have gone back to Ukraine and they are residing mostly in the western part of the East European country.\n\nSeveral Indian medical students were left with no choice after their evacuation from Ukraine and transferred to universities in other countries to continue their studies. Many have gone to Russia, Serbia and other European countries.\n\nDr Zafar Aminov, Vice Chancellor, of Samarkand State Medical University, said when the war broke out, the Indian Embassy reached out to them enquiring if the affected students could seek a transfer.\n\n“We evaluated the requirements of such students and then ultimately decided that enrolling them with a semester back would be a viable option to provide equivalence. We then set up a team to facilitate transfers and also made special arrangements for these students. We hired 30 more Indian teachers to ensure there are no accent issues,” he told PTI.\n\nAminov said the university has accommodated over 1,000 Indian transfer students from Ukraine.\n\nDeepika Kaidala Jayaramaiah, a student from Karnataka, said after seeing the war situation right in front of her, moving to a peaceful country was the priority.\n\n“I have only read about war in history books. Never imagined that I would witness the situation in person. After it was evident that going to Ukraine was not an option now, I decided to resume my medical journey in Uzbekistan,” she said.\n",

It also played a key role in the launching of the Covid-19 vaccine. in November 2020.\n\nAnd now they are “promising” us a crisis which is “Much Worse than Covid”.\n\nOver the last three years the deliberate triggering of chaos has become part of a broad and complex agenda: the war in Ukraine, the hike in energy prices, the triggering of bankruptcies, the collapse of economic activity, widespread poverty, famine and despair.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nIn recent developments, Washington has endorsed Israel’s genocide directed against the People of Palestine, coupled with an unfolding US-NATO-Israel military agenda against the broader Middle East.\n\nCyber-Attacks\n\nThe article below focusses on the imminent dangers of Cyber Warfare, which have already been announced by the World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\nIn 2021, the WEF conducted a simulation of Cyber Attacks involving a scenario of Paralysis of the Power Supply, Communications, Transportation, The Internet.\n\nKlaus Schwab intimated in no uncertain terms based on “a simulated scenario” that a cyber-attack:\n\n“Could bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole …\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack.” (emphasis added)\n\nWhat does Schwab have up his sleeve?\n\nA “Cyber Terrorist Attack” conducive to unprecedented disruptions? Is this something that we should take seriously?\n\nA renewed fear campaign, a warning of an impending danger? In the words of Jeremy Jurgens, who is the WEF’s Managing Director:\n\n“I believe that there will be another crisis. It will be more significant. It will be faster than what we’ve seen with COVID. The impact will be greater, and as a result the economic and social implications will be even more significant.” (emphasis added)\n\nThe 2021 WEF cyber polygon simulation scenario had an obvious “contradictory” geopolitical slant:\n\nThe event was chaired by Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, numerous Russian financial institutions, media and communications entities had been invited by the WEF.\n\nForty-eight countries participated in the Event, there were 41 partners of which 10 were from Russia and Kazakhstan: these included News Agency TASS, NTV, Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank and a leading global financial institution, the Mail.ru Group, Russia’s largest internet provider, MTS, Russia’s leading telecommunications group, the State Legal Department of the Omsk Region, Siberia. Powerful banking financial institutions from Kazakstan. Among others.\n\nSee also the assumptions of the Training Program, which are predicated on terrorist cyber hackers.\n\nAmply documented, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has been instrumental in endorsing US-NATO’s military agenda in regards to Ukraine.\n\nWas this July 2021 Cyber Polygon event (which occurred less than 8 months prior to the outset of the Ukraine War) intent upon creating political divisions within the Russian Federation by establishing partnerships with a number of powerful Russian media, communications, banking and financial institutions, etc.\n\nNot a single representative from the People’s Republic of China. Was the Cyber Polygon Simulation (July 2021) intended to foster confrontation between China and Russia? Are Cyber attacks contemplated as part of a Global Military agenda?\n\nThe Process of “All-Digitization”\n\nIn November 2023, as documented in an article by Peter Koenig, the Financial Elites passed from the “study of scenarios” to “implementation”. They entrusted the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) “as the flag-carrier … for the deadly onslaught of All-Digitization.”",

Joe Biden denied the meeting described took place.\n\nIn March of this year, The New York Times backed up portions of the Post's reporting on the Hunter Biden emails.\n\n\"Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation,\" the Times reported.\n\nNow, Parlatore has filed letters of complaint with the agencies that had employed the 51 former intel officials.\n\nThe letters cite \"an egregious breach\" by former agency employees \"that appears to have been overlooked by your agency, as it has gone uninvestigated and certainly unpunished. Specifically, the unauthorized publication and dissemination of an intelligence assessment, purportedly based on classified information that was used wrongfully to influence the outcome of an election.\"\n\nAccording to a Post opinion piece by journalist Miranda Devine, letters were sent to John Hollister Hedley, chairman of the Publication Classification Review Board at the CIA; Gen.

The first batch of students are already on their way to the airport for departure, while the second and third batches would depart on November 15 and November 17 respectively.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Universities Education in the ministry, Rakiya Ilyasu, Mamman advised the scholars not to see the opportunity as uncontrolled freedom to do things that would be to their disgrace.\n\nHe explained that the country had invested a lot in them and as such required the returns of investment on their return to the country.\n\n“Note that you are few out of thousands who secured this opportunity which you must not take for granted. Your parents and teachers would also be happy with your succor.\n\n“Your selection is part of a broader plan which ensures that brilliant Nigerians, especially those that cannot afford to study programmes that are not readily available in Nigeria, are supported to get necessary knowledge, skills and competence that would be useful in Nigeria’s development agenda.\n\n“I am happy to inform you that in spite of the global economic meltdown, the number of our development partners have increased and many of them now offer scholarship to Nigeria.\n\n“As you prepare to travel out, ensure to uphold and eschew good values, focus on your studies and be a good ambassador of your country,” he said.\n\nThe Minister also charged the scholars to always strive to abide by the laws of their host country and as well remember to be their brother’s keeper in their new environment.\n\n“Most importantly, you need to make your presence known to the Nigerian Embassy in Moscow. This is very necessary based on our experiences from Ukraine.\n\n“Your parents are also spending a lot of resources on you. Note that we all expert you return to our dear country at the end of your studies to assist Nigeria to become a better place by contributing your quota to its development, using your new knowledge and skills,” he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Director, Federal Scholarship Board, Asta Ndajiwo said the journey began in November 2022 with applications from thousands of Nigerians which later translated to the nomination of the candidates. Ndajiwo commended the Federal Government efforts especially in the payment of the scholars allowances from September to December.\n\nShe also advised the scholars to do away with any extracurricular activities that could take their lives, recalling an incident with previous two scholars who lost their lives while swimming in a pool.\n\n“We regret loosing two Nigerians scholars in Russia in the past that went to swim and in the process got drowned. We don’t want to loose anyone again and so we advise you stay away from water if you cannot swim.\n\n“We want you to be your brother’s keeper, work hard and face your studies as you also be a good ambassador of the country.",

But Tennis Australia suspended that policy for the two countries involved in the invasion of Ukraine that began nearly a year ago.\n\n“Our initial policy was that fans could bring [flags] in but could not use them to cause disruption,” Tennis Australia said in a statement Tuesday. “Yesterday we had an incident where a flag was placed courtside. We will continue to work with the players and our fans to ensure that this is the best possible environment to enjoy the tennis.”\n\nOne Russian flag was displayed during Ukrainian player Kateryna Baindl’s 7-5, 6-7 (8), 6-1 victory over Russian player Kamilla Rakhimova on Court 14 in the first round Monday.\n\nAnother was offered to Russian player Daniil Medvedev to autograph after his 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 win over Marcos Giron in Rod Laver Arena on Monday night.\n\nAsked about the new flag ban, Belarusian player Aryna Sabalenka said after her first-round victory Tuesday that she would prefer that politics and sports remain separate but that she understands the decision by Tennis Australia.\n\nJessica Pegula and Coco Gauff each pick up wins in the first round of the Australian Open as they begin their quest for a first Grand Slam title.\n\n“I mean, if everyone feels better this way, then it’s OK,” said Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam semifinalist who is seeded No. 5 at Melbourne Park. “I have zero control on it. What can I say? They did it. OK. No flags? No flags.”\n\nSabalenka was among the athletes from Russia and Belarus who were barred last year from competing at Wimbledon and team events such as the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup because of the war in Ukraine. Russia invaded, with help from Belarus, in February.\n\nRussian and Belarusian players have been allowed to enter the other three Grand Slam tournaments but as “neutral” athletes, so their nationalities are not acknowledged on any official schedules or results for the event and their countries’ flags are not displayed on TV graphics.",

Hailing from five countries, the mercenaries had been captured while fighting for Kiev.\n\nThe prisoners, who are citizens of Croatia, Morocco, Sweden, the UK and the US, were transferred from Russia to Saudi Arabia by Saudi authorities, according to a statement from the ministry. Saudi officials are now “facilitating procedures for their safe return to their respective countries,” the announcement continued.\n\nBin Salman personally negotiated the release, which took place as part of a wider exchange of prisoners of war between Russia and Ukraine, the ministry added.\n\nThe full details of the POW exchange are unclear, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Moscow and Kiev had agreed to exchange 200 prisoners. This exchange would be the largest such swap since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began in February.\n\nErdogan, whose government helped broker a deal earlier this summer to restart grain shipments from Ukrainian ports, said this exchange represented “a very important step.”\n\nIn addition to receiving tens of billions of dollars worth of Western arms, Ukraine has leaned heavily on foreign mercenaries to bolster its military. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, more than 2,000 of these foreign fighters have been eliminated by Russian troops and the militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.\n\nShoigu said on Wednesday that just over 1,000 foreigners remain active in the ranks of the Ukrainian military.

The message of the Paris Pact for People and the Planet is that we must all take our part to allow each country to alleviate poverty and tackle climate change,” said France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou. “This includes states, which must support development policies with sufficient resources. For this reason, I am particularly pleased to announce, on behalf of France and President Macron, the allocation of €40 million to support ECW’s actions for the 2023-2026 cycle.”\n\n“With this new bold and generous contribution, France shines as an example for others to follow,” said ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif. “We call on government donors, philanthropic foundations, and the private sector to follow suit and join our collective efforts to mobilize a total of US$1.5 billion by 2026 to provide quality education to 20 million crisis-affected girls and boys so they can learn, grow and rebuild their societies.”\n\nGlobally, around 224 million children are deprived of a quality education due to armed conflicts, forced displacement, climate-induced disasters and other protracted crises. They need urgent support to fulfil their right to a quality, inclusive education.\n\nTogether with strategic partners, ECW has already reached close to 9 million girls and boys in some of the harshest crises around the globe.\n\nWhile donors are stepping up, the funding gap has actually widened in recent years. Humanitarian appeals for education in emergencies have nearly tripled from US$1.1 billion in 2019 to almost US$3 billion at the end of 2022.\n",

As caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar leads Pakistan’s representation, transparency emerges as a cornerstone for effective policy-making and attracting climate-related financing.\n\nThe IMF’s recommendation to make the FY 2024-25 budget a turning point for climate adaptation planning underscores the imperative to integrate climate considerations into financial decisions. Seeking transparency on climate-related actions with budgetary implications aligns with the global recognition of the need to harmonise financial decisions with climate goals. This emphasis reflects an acknowledgment that fiscal sustainability analysis under diverse climate change scenarios is vital for informed decision-making.\n\nDespite capacity constraints, the urgent call to train staff for climate initiatives underscores the necessity of investing in the nation’s ability to navigate climate challenges. Strengthening the capacity of relevant ministries, including the Ministry of Climate Change, Planning Commission, and Climate Change Authority, aligns with broader goals such as achieving National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and National Determined Contributions (NDC) targets.\n\nThe IMF’s recommendation to publish climate-related spending for FY 2023-24, coupled with advancing green budgeting, signifies a commitment to transparency and accountability. Extending the green tracking system to all provinces, supported by the controller general of accounts, emphasises the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach.\n\nAs part of the ongoing $3 billion standby arrangement, fulfilling the structural benchmark regarding climate public investment plans is crucial for meeting international commitments. Strengthening the appraisal process for investments and projects, including specific guidance on climate factors, ensures comparability and alignment with climate targets. The IMF’s holistic advice to adapt the entire budget formulation and approval process to climate change requirements signifies a forward-looking approach. Integrating summary information in budget papers, specifying the number and value of climate-related projects, and considering major current issues like flood recovery and projects of public interest ensures a comprehensive alignment with climate-conscious financial decisions.\n\nThe IMF’s call for enhanced transparency in Pakistan’s budgetary considerations for climate adaptation, amidst the nation’s active engagement at COP28, is pivotal for shaping a sustainable future. As Pakistan seeks international support, a commitment to transparency and climate-conscious financial decisions will play a crucial role in navigating the global shift towards sustainable practices.",

While urgent action is needed to address the climate emergency, carbon capture is not a real solution. (“Will storing CO2 in old oil fields slow global warming?

Leaders in Moscow and Beijing, however, have argued otherwise.\n\nSpeaking at a campaign reception in Washington, Biden bragged about how he convinced Japan and South Korea to send financial aid to Ukraine, and how he signed a rail and ports deal with the EU, India, and Saudi Arabia at the G20 summit in New Delhi last month.\n\n“So, I think we have an opportunity to do things, if we’re bold enough and have enough confidence in ourselves, to unite the world in ways that it never has been,” Biden declared.\n\n“We were in a post-war period for 50 years where it worked pretty damn well, but that’s sort of run out of steam. Sort of run out of steam. We need a new, new world order in a sense,” he continued.\n\nThe world order that emerged following the Second World War was a bipolar one, with the US and USSR vying for influence and geopolitical supremacy. The collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in a unipolar world order, with the US the sole superpower. As the USSR disintegrated, then-US President George HW Bush proclaimed victory in the Cold War and the dawning of a “new world order” in his 1991 State of the Union address.\n\nThree decades later, and with Washington scrambling for funds to fight two foreign wars, American dominance is less assured. China’s economy was the world’s eleventh largest in 1991, but is now second to only the US’. With Beijing expanding its nuclear arsenal and modernizing its military, President Xi Jinping has referred to the US-led West as “declining” on multiple occasions, and hailed the emergence of a “multipolar world,” in which international relations are governed by laws and treaties, rather than US-enforced “rules.”",

[bold, links added]\n\n…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”\n\nHe also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”\n\nEchoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.\n\nAnd he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”\n\nFinally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.\n\nh/t Rúnar O.\n\nRead rest at ZeroHedge\n\nJoin our list\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.\n\nFundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out.

Here comes the latest Postwar Gravy Train, laden with massive government spending, lax oversight and other goodies for cunning contractors and economic opportunists seeking to benefit from the near-destruction of Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the State Department announced it intends to seize Russian assets in the United States to help fund rebuilding efforts, though the estimated $300 billion here and in Europe won’t cover the projected price tag of $500 billion. “What Putin destroyed, Russia should – must – pay to rebuild,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.\n\nLike an earlier generation of interventionists, Blinken cites the “Pottery Barn rule” – You Break It, You Own It – to explain an aggressor’s moral obligation to rebuild. Colin Powell used the same reasoning in the summer of 2002, as a \"caution\" to President George W. Bush about the consequences of military action in Iraq. A major difference is the dollars at stake. American and European firms undoubtedly are eager to reconstruct a modern, high-tech country from the ground up.\n\nOur government seeks every opportunity to impose itself, at home and abroad, but has a poor track record for managing projects.\n\nNo-bid contract awards, bribes and billions of missing dollars are the legacy of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s rebuilding work in Iraq, where officials concluded that not enough was accomplished for the amount of funds expended. We learned that when taxpayer money is plentiful, oversight and results will be negligible. Just imagine how generous and hands-off our government might be spending Russia’s money.\n\nNot everyone endorses the act of confiscating Russia’s money, pointing to the principle of reciprocity as a reason to show restraint. “Stealing” the assets of a foreign country sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied against us. For example, what if China confiscates American assets to fund rebuilding projects in Libya, Iraq or other nations the United States has damaged through war?\n\nThe DC hype-meisters talk about the Great Power Competition of wannabe superpowers; they tell us that China is on the brink of becoming the dominant international force, that Russia is preparing to seize all of Europe. Here, though, the façade falls away—the elites believe the United States has no economic or military peers. When you’re as rich and mighty as America, there’s no fear of reciprocity.\n\nThe elites will do what’s in the immediate best interest of their friends, which include certain corporations and investors who will benefit from the most extensive international project since World War II. For this group, the only morality is a morality of power: Treating other nations the way you want to be treated is a rule for losers and weaker players.\n\nBlinken and the politicians talk about our categorical imperative in Ukraine, how the world relies on America to “defend democracy” and “protect the rules-based order.” But their words ring hollow. The cynical truth is that what Russia breaks, America will take—using confiscated money to fund a massive rebuilding project that will be poorly managed, but lucrative for the chosen few involved.\n\nCitizen Soldier believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.",

Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said she lives in Kenya with solar power and clean electricity from the local utility.\n\n“I'm not living in a cave,\" she added.\n\n\"That's all I can say.”\n\nThe remarks from Al Jaber draw criticism from scientists and are in contrast with the view of Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who said at the climate summit on Friday,\n\n“The science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.”\n\nAl Jaber’s presidency of COP28 has stirred controversy in recent months. He is the first CEO designated to be president of any climate summit so far. But he is also the chief executive of the national oil company of OPEC's third-largest producer, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n“The recent comments from COP28 President show how entrenched he is in fossil fuel fantasy and is clearly determined that this COP doesn’t do anything to harm the interests of the oil and gas industry,\" said Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa.\n\n“These remarks are a wake-up call to the world and negotiators at COP28 that they are not going to get any help from the COP presidency in delivering a strong outcome on a fossil fuel phase-out and will need to work hard to ensure a few petro-state leaders don’t imperil the planet in their efforts to protect their oil profits.\"\n\nLast week, Al Jaber denied reports of plans to use the climate summit in Dubai to push oil deals.\n\nEarlier last week, the BBC and many other news outlets reported that the UAE planned to use its role as the host of climate talks to forge new oil and gas deals. The BBC cited leaked briefing documents obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working alongside the BBC. Those documents were purportedly prepared by the UAE’s COP28 team for meetings with at least 27 foreign governments during the climate summit which Dubai will host from November 30 to December 12.",

The preparations are for a “long-term confrontation”.\n\nA growing number of Western rulers have also warned of a military threat from Russia to countries along the eastern flank of NATO, calling for Europe to get prepared by rearming.\n\nThe chief of the intelligence service said the assessment was based on Russian plans to double the number of forces stationed along its border with NATO members Finland and the Baltic States of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. “Russia has chosen a path which is a long-term confrontation … and the Kremlin is probably anticipating a possible conflict with NATO within the next decade or so,” Kaupo Rosin told reporters at the release of Estonia’s national security threats report, according to a report by The New York Post.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nRosin claimed that a military attack by Russia is “highly unlikely” in the short term, partly because Russia has to keep troops in Ukraine, and that would be unlikely if the Russian buildup of forces was matched in Europe. “If we are not prepared, the likelihood (of a military Russian attack) would be much higher than without any preparation,” Rosin added.\n\nEstonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to over 2% of the value of their economies after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and NATO allies have raised their presence in those countries.\n\nGermany plans to have 4,800 combat-ready troops in the region by 2027, in its first permanent foreign deployment since World War Two, and Rosin said NATO and its allies were moving in the right direction to counter the Russian threat. –The New York Post.\n\nRussia has repeatedly warned that it will go to war with NATO if the West’s weapons defeat Russia, or lethal aid is sent to Ukraine. One could argue that the West has crossed that line, but Russia has yet to follow through with an attack on NATO.\n\nRussia Warns NATO A Nuclear War Will Ensue If Western Weapons Defeat Russia\n\nThe bad news is that Russia’s ability to provide ammunition to its troops is continuing to outweigh Ukraine’s.

Were that to actually happen, cafes and other eateries would no longer be able to run their businesses.\n\n\"For 35 years, we've been attacked by everybody,\" Morfogen told Carlson. \"We had organized crime in our industry in the '30s, '70s, '80s and '90s. In the 2000s, we had corrupt Wall Street, and for the last three years we've had government overreach.\"\n\n\"I mean, we've seen it during covid – they did things and never followed the science and what's going on. I heard a rumor about this last year, and what I'm hearing about today from the White House to Gov. Hochul, that they want to make us, for new restaurant construction, use electric stoves.\"\n\nNot only would gas stoves be banned in new construction under Hochul's plan, but so would gas heaters. Everyone would be forced to use costly and highly inefficient electric cooking and heating appliances, which would also place enormous strain on the electrical grid. (Related: In Europe, the ongoing energy crisis is causing some to have to burn wood for warm meals and heat.)\n\nAccording to Hochul and other Democrats, the planet's climate is supposedly changing because of gas use. In order to stop the climate from changing, electric must be the only source of energy used – even if it comes from coal, ironically enough.\n\n\"So let me explain it to you: we lose 40 percent productivity by using electric,\" Morfogen further stated. \"If they inquire with small business owners, I'll give them three pieces of advice: get a stronger filtration system; get a hood system that works; and, basically, train your staff how to maintain it.\"\n\nCiting a single study claiming that gas stoves contribute to 12.7 percent of all cases of asthma in children, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is attempting to implement a nationwide ban on gas stoves – because freedom of choice is not one of that group's values.\n\n\"For 35 years, we continuously have obstacles in running our industry,\" Morfogen added during the interview.\n\n\"I've got to tell you, Tucker – and I want to thank you for supporting small business – since the last time I was on, you inspired me to write the book. And I've got to tell you, our journey is constantly being attacked, like, we're vulnerable and this is the crème de la crème, because I will tell you, this will destroy our industry just as bad as they attempted to do with covid.\"\n\nIf you are interested in watching the Tucker Carlson segment featuring Morfogen, you can do so at this link.\n\nBearing the nickname \"Golden Greek,\" Morfogen has owned and operated a number of top restaurants in New York City – at least 41 of them, in fact. He told the New York Post last summer that thievery, economic downturns, demolition problems, and changing neighborhoods are among the many reasons why his restaurants have come and gone over the years.\n\n\"Our industry was then like the Wild West,\" he explained. \"There comes a knock on the door and you have to pay protection so the mob doesn't break your window or your manager's legs.\"\n\nThe new mob, apparently, are Democrats and their \"green\" tyranny solutions to climate problems that are entirely nonexistent outside of their own deranged heads.\n\nThe latest news about the Democrats and their hair-brained ideas can be found at Libtards.news.\n\nSources for this article include:",

If that is achieved, then the Big Three can stay open until 2049.\n\nAfter that, the report states, all airports, including the Big Three, will need to be closed down permanently, leaving residents trapped right where they are. This, we are told, will \"cool\" down the planet and create a climate utopia.\n\n\"In order to meet this legal commitment, the report states that every citizen of the United Kingdom will need to 'stop using aeroplanes' for a significant period of time,\" reported The Exposé about how the scheme is outlined to work.\n\nIn order to fully comply with the Climate Change Act, airports are not the only thing that has to go. The same report states that the general public will need to stop flying as well as stop doing anything else that creates \"emissions,\" regardless of the energy source.\n\nMeat consumption, for instance, will also need to end because raising cows for beef and sheep for lamb is bad for the environment, the globalists claim. Genetically modified (GMO) soybeans and corn, on the other hand, which have to be doused in deadly chemicals in order to grow, are good for the environment and can stay.\n\nBy 2029, these climate extremists want people in the UK to reduce their meat consumption by 50 percent. The remaining 50 percent will need to be \"phased out\" between 2030 and 2049.\n\nNo more new buildings will be allowed after 2049 either. Pretty much anything that falls into the category of economic activity will need to go, which also means that all people – except for the globalists, of course – will also need to disappear in order to stop them from emitting their very existence and polluting the envisioned globalist utopia.\n\n\"The underlying point is that any asset which uses carbon will have essentially zero value in 2050,\" the report states. \"This in turn may encourage greater use in the run up to 2050 – for example, putting up new buildings at a much faster rate for the next 30 years, knowing that construction must then halt.\"\n\nThe report, by the way, was released in 2019 just prior to covid. In many ways, it serves as a blueprint for what is still to come, which is being catalyzed by the global upheaval that was foisted upon the world in the name of fighting the \"pandemic.\"\n\n\"It is possible that the events of the past two and half years are part of a larger, more sinister agenda that is only just beginning,\" is how The Expose puts it.\n\nMore related news about how stopping climate change and global warming is code for mass depopulation and genocide can be found at Climate.news.\n\nSources for this article include:",

COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country taking part in solving global environmental problems, editor of London-based Energy Intelligence Michael Ritchie told Trend.\n\n\"During COP29 in November, all eyes will be on Azerbaijan. The event will be attended by tens of thousands of journalists, participants, and delegates. There will also be questions about why the oil and gas producer is taking part in the climate talks. But COP29 follows immediately after this conference in the United Arab Emirates, also a major oil and gas producer. The UK, where I come from, is also an oil and gas producer and has also hosted this conference. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country that is taking part in solving global environmental problems,\" Ritchie said.\n\nAccording to him, COP29 is crucial to achieve financial goals and to obtain additional funds, possibly from developed countries, for climate finance. It will also lay the groundwork for the next COP30 in Brazil.\n\nTo note, Azerbaijan will host the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) in November this year. The decision was made at the plenary meeting of COP28 held in Dubai on December 11 last year. Within two weeks, Baku, having become the center of the world, will host about 70,000–80,000 foreign guests.\n\nThe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is an agreement signed at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992 to prevent dangerous human interference in the climate system. The acronym COP (Conference of Parties) stands for Conference of Parties, which is the highest legislative body overseeing the implementation of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nThe parties to the convention are 198 countries. Unless the parties have decided otherwise, COP is held annually. The first COP event was held in March 1995 in Germany's Berlin, and its secretariat is located in Bonn.\n\nStay up-to-date with more news on Trend News Agency's WhatsApp channel",

        "content": "Shapps Says UK Facing ‘Pre-War World’ and Can’t Risk Cutting Defence Spending \n\n Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said Britain is in a “pre-war world” and cannot afford to reduce spending on the military.\n\nIn a major speech at Lancaster House in London, Mr. Shapps said the “peace dividend” that followed the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s was over.\n\nMr. Shapps said: “Because the era of the peace dividend is over, in five years’ time we could be looking at multiple theatres including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.”\n\n“Ask yourself, looking at today’s conflicts across the world, is it more likely that that number grows or reduces? I suspect we all know the answer. It’s likely to grow,” he added.\n\nMr. Shapps also announced 20,000 British service personnel would take part in NATO’s largest military exercises since the Cold War, following the announcement last week of a £2.5 billion support package to Ukraine.\n\nOver the weekend the RAF carried out air strikes with U.S. forces on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, after they targeted merchant shipping in their campaign against Israel.\n\nThe British government has set a goal of increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, but Mr. Shapps has argued it should rise to 3 percent.\n\nHis speech on Monday—in front of an audience including top brass in the British military—might be seen as pushing the argument for increased defence spending.\n\nMr. Shapps said, “We made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5 percent of GDP on defence, and as we stabilise and grow this economy we’ll continue to strive to reach that as soon as possible.”\n\n“But now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same thing and ensure their defence spending is growing too,” he added.\n\n‘The Tanks Are Literally on Europe’s Ukrainian Lawn’The defence secretary said: “An age of idealism has been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism. Today our adversaries are busy rebuilding their barriers, old enemies are reanimated, new foes are taking shape, battle lines are being redrawn.”\n\n“The tanks are literally on Europe’s Ukrainian lawn and the foundations of the world order being shaken to their core,” he added.\n\nMr. Shapps refused to rule out further action against the Houthis following the weekend attacks.\n\nHe said the strike against the Houthis was a “single action” but added, “We will now monitor very carefully to see what they do next, how they respond and we will see from there.”\n\nLater Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would “not hesitate” to protect British shipping in the Red Sea.\n\nMr. Sunak told Sky News, “As we’ve said, not just to the Houthis but to their Iranian masters, in a sense, because they are really proxies for Tehran, this cannot go on.”\n\n“Freedom of navigation is just a given and always has been for many years. We cannot have that situation where they are trying to harass it, and we will keep a very close eye. If we have to take further action, that is something that we will consider,” he said.\n\nHe added, “They should be aware that if it doesn’t stop then of course we will then have to take the decisions that need to be taken.”",

Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of deceased opposition activist Alexei Navalny, is urging mass protests against President Putin as he stands of the verge of winning another six year term as president, an outcome quite obvious to all observers. She's calling on Russians to disrupt the final day of voting in what's been dubbed \"noon against Putin\".\n\nWhile some sporadic minor incidents at polling stations have been reported, there has been a major incident in the small country of Moldova which borders Ukraine. Moldovan police have detained a man who attacked the Russian embassy with two Molotov cocktails as voting was underway there.\n\n\"A man threw two containers of flammable substances over the fence of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau,\" police said in a statement. A 54-year-old Moldovan who described himself as also having Russian citizenship was immediately detained after after hurling the Molotov cocktails.\n\nThere were no reports of injuries or damage to the embassy, and police said an investigation is ongoing. \"He justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities,\" authorities said.\n\nMoldova has been scene of controversy and friction especially after Russia allowed the opening of several polling stations in breakaway Transnistria, which the Moldovan government has fiercely protested.\n\nReuters noted days ago that \"A senior official in ex-Soviet Moldova said on Wednesday Moscow was breaking laws by printing ballot papers in the separatist region of Transnistria ahead of this week's Russian presidential election.\"\n\n\"Moldova's pro-European authorities have already summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about a decision to open six polling stations in the pro-Russian enclave,\" the report continued. \"The central government said the move broke an agreement to allow voting only at a single polling station at the Russian embassy in Chisinau.\"\n\nThe United States recently become more vocal in defending Moldova's territorial integrity, and has condemned what the Biden administration has called Moscow's 'interference' in the Eastern European nation's sovereignty.\n\nLast summer, Moldova expelled 45 Russian diplomats and embassy staff members from the country \"over numerous unfriendly actions\" as tensions reached near breaking point over the war in neighboring Ukraine and the Transnistria issue. As for Russia's election, Kremlin authorities have said Ukraine is engaged in cross-border attacks on polling stations and in annexed regions of Ukraine.",

Washington has already sent 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers to Ukraine. The Pentagon also plans to send 18 more HIMARS launchers at a cost of $1.1 billion.\n\nIn December 2022, the U.S. Army granted a $431 million contract to Lockheed Martin to produce HIMARS launchers to replenish its stocks as well as restock the supplies of its partners and allies who militarily support Ukraine. In October 2022, Lockheed was awarded a $14.4 million contract to raise the production capacity of the HIMARS launchers to 96 per year from 60.\n\nIn November 2022, Lockheed Martin won a $521 million contract to add to U.S. stocks of multiple-launch guided rocket systems, which also are supplied to Ukraine. The company has a positive outlook for its future business prospects.\n\nRaytheon ContractsRaytheon won a $1.2 billion contract from the U.S. Army in November 2022 to deliver six National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) batteries to Ukraine.\n\nThe contract was a follow-up to an August 2022 contract for a batch of NASAMS batteries. Two batteries have been delivered and deployed in the nation. In the United States, a NASAMS is in place to defend the national capital region from potential air threats.\n\nRaytheon also produces the Stinger and Javelin missiles, both of which have been used in Ukraine. The company received a $624 million contract from the U.S. government for the Stinger missiles.\n\nAt a panel forum in December 2022, Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes revealed that the first 10 months of the Ukraine war consumed as many Javelin missiles as Raytheon and Lockheed Martin produced in five years and as many Stinger missiles as the firm produced in 13 years.\n\nDuring the company’s third-quarter earnings call in October 2022, Hayes said the organization was doing good business.\n\nWashington’s Ukraine SpendingThe United States has so far allocated $113 billion in assistance to Ukraine, of which $24.2 billion has been used for security assistance since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nThe massive U.S. spending on the Ukraine war has attracted criticism from some Republicans. Last month, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) argued that those funds could have benefited U.S. citizens.\n\nOn Jan. 19, the Pentagon announced $2.5 billion in additional assistance to Kyiv, with plans to send 59 Bradley fighting vehicles, 90 Stryker combat vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition.",

But the warmer temperatures this season are kicking off the blooming period earlier.\n\n\"We're seeing, if you will, some confusion in the trees about this,\" he said. \"Our primary indicator tree is showing four different stages of the bloom process depending on which branches you're looking at.\"\n\nBut blossoms are not the only visitors that may pay us a visit sooner rather than later.\n\n\"This could turn out to be a very buggy year,\" University of Maryland Professor Emeritus of Entomology Michael Raupp said.\n\nMichael Raupp, otherwise known as \"The Bug Guy,\" said with blossoms expected to open two weeks sooner, we can expect to see more pollinators.\n\n\"The honeybees are busy,\" Raupp said. \"The carpenter bees are out looking for pollen sources right now.\"\n\nThough you may be tempted to show a little more skin because of the warmer weather, mosquitoes will be out in full force. So, have some extra bug spray on hand.\n\n\"At the temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit, it will take mosquitoes about two to three weeks to develop but at 90 degrees Fahrenheit they're going to do it in one week,\" Raupp said. \"That means we will have twice as many generations in the same amount of time.\"\n\nA spike in ticks is also a concern as it could lead to lime disease and red meat allergies.\n\nRaupp said if you spot a tick on your body after a hike remove it in the first 24 hours. Then, wash your clothes and dry them for half an hour to kill any remaining ticks.\n\n\"The bugs that have been just hanging out there just waiting for a little warmth, hey guess what, they got it in spades right now,\" he said.\n\nMaryland's growers are also facing some challenges because of the early heat.\n\n\"We're already hearing reports from our growers around the state that the Alfalfa Weevil, which is an important pest on certain crops and usually doesn't appear for several weeks, is actually active now and beginning to create damage on our forage crops,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Raupp and Litterst say because of climate change all these changes are not surprising and may just become our new norm.",

Russia and China are also members of the G-20 which operate on the principle of consensus.\n\nIn his bilateral meeting with Putin in Uzbekistan on September 16, Modi said \"today's era is not of war\" and nudged him to end the conflict.\n\nThe Indian delegation played a big role in achieving consensus among member states over the wording criticising the Russian invasion, the Financial Times (FT) said, citing two unnamed officials with knowledge of the negotiations.\n\nPrime Minister Modi and several leaders of the G20 countries touched upon the Ukraine crisis in their remarks at the grouping's summit that began in Bali on Tuesday.\n\nWorld leaders will state that today's era \"must not be of war\" at the G20 summit in Bali, according to a draft communique agreed by diplomats that also condemned threats of nuclear weapons use, the newspaper said.\n\n\"The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible.

Today's era must not be of war,\" the draft statement said, according to FT.\n\nThe communique was agreed by country delegates on Monday night but must still be signed off by G20 leaders at the two-day summit, the report said.\n\nThe G20 \"will make clear that Russia's war is wreaking havoc for people everywhere\", the report said, quoting a senior US official.\n\nAn Indonesian official said discussions on the draft statement were \"still dynamic\" and might change, it said.\n\nIn his address at the summit, Modi on Tuesday referred to his repeated call for resolving the crisis through talks.\n\n\"I have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine. Over the past century, the Second World War wreaked havoc in the world,\" he said.\n\nSince the Ukraine conflict began in February, Prime Minister Modi spoke to Russian President Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a number of times.\n\nIn a phone conversation with Zelenskyy on October 4, Modi said that there can be \"no military solution\" and that India is ready to contribute to any peace efforts.\n\nIndia has not yet condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it has been maintaining that the crisis must be resolved through diplomacy and dialogue.",

Russia went on to appoint a Moscow-friendly mayor in Melitopol.\n\nWhile commenting on the kidnapping of Fedorov, which was partially captured on video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that \"the actions of Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.\"\n\nKlitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of \"un-human\" Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war, noting that mayors are civilian targets.\n\n\"War also has rules,\" said Klitschko. \"But Russians [don't] want the rules ... what they want is the symbol ... they can't break the mood of the people and that's why they kidnap the mayors.\"\n\n\"Its actually against all rules,\" Klitschko continued. \"We see how unfriendly, how un-human activity make Russians in our land.\"\n\nFollowing Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside his brother Wladimir Klitschko, who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion.\n\n\"That's what Russia's war against the civilians looks like,\" Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter. \"Destroyed buildings, destroyed infrastructure.

Today, the former German interior minister is sharply criticising his former parties regarding their stance on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the management of the economy and the direction energy policy has taken.\n\nFormer German Interior Minister Otto Schily cautioned against the dangers of Germany taking an unilateral course in the Ukraine conflict, while at the same time clearly arguing in favour of war. „A bellicosity has developed in Germany, which is risky,” Mr Schily told the German Press Agency.\n\n“The Greens, of all people, are too one-sided. There is too little thought about how we can get out of the conflict,”\n\nsaid the former Social Democrat politician, emphasizing that he unreservedly condemns the war and the bloodshed it brings. He added that instead of deepening the conflict, the German federal government should be seeking to find other prospects for Ukraine besides being sent money and weapons. Constructive ideas and political imagination are needed, he said.\n\nMr Schily also told the press agency how he sees the tense situation that has unfolded:\n\n„Ukraine wants to remain independent. Everyone has to acknowledge that. At the same time it must be clear that one has to live with one’s neighbours, including with Russia. Both sides have interests that must be taken into account. Russia will always remain a factor, also with regard to Europe. We have to find a way to deal with the Russians.”\n\nFormer Chancellor Gerhard Schroder’s interior minister believes that it would not be a good move for Ukraine to join NATO. He pointed out that Ukraine’s multilingualism, including the Russian language, is an indisputable fact. Taking a look at other countries shows that the interests of all sides can be safeguarded if a country remains militarily neutral. Mr Schily also sees Ukraine’s accession to the EU as unrealistic and recommends that Ukraine follow the „Swiss model”.\n\nSwitzerland is an excellent example of „how to develop a free society with mutual respect for the different ethnic backgrounds and with military neutrality. Ukraine could take Switzerland as an example,”\n\nhe said, adding that he doesn’t see “how Ukraine’s accession to the EU could work without the EU overstretching.”\n\nMr Schily expressly warned that the German government should not overburden the country economically. He also criticised the three-party coalition government because even amidst the energy crisis, they fail to realise how unwise it is to phase out nuclear power just because the Greens insist on it.\n\n“Now it’s becoming even clearer that completely giving up on nuclear technology was foolish. The total abandonment of nuclear technology has placed us in a very precarious economic situation. Due to the simultaneous phase-out of nuclear power and coal, Germany has become reliant on natural gas,”\n\nhe pointed out.",

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, a meeting of the Fertiliser Supply and Distribution Management Committee has decided to reduce the previously given subsidy of 70.82 per cent and maintain it at 59.04 per cent for the meantime.\n\nThe committee has also decided to gradually reduce the subsidy to around 50 per cent as per a statement issued by the ministry. As per the decision, urea fertilser will cost Rs 25 per kg, DPA (Di-ammonium Phosphate) fertiliser Rs 50 per kg and potash fertilser Rs 40 per kg. Before the decision, urea used to be sold at Rs 14 per kg, DAP at Rs 43 per kg and potash at Rs 31 per kg. The prices for the listed fertilisers have now increased by Rs 11, Rs 7 and Rs 9 per kg, respectively.\n\nEarlier, the government was providing a subsidy of 80 per cent on urea, 60 per cent on DAP and 59 per cent on potash.\n\nAccording to the ministry, the decision was made as per the request of the Ministry of Finance to reduce the subsidy given on the procurement of chemical fertilisers, stating that the prices of the chemical fertilisers have increased in the international market due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and disruption in their supply chain. The Finance Ministry has said the government was losing a big portion of the budget due to the high cost of imports and high subsidy given on the sale of the chemical fertilisers to the farmers. As per the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, the country needs to import as much as 520,000 metric tons of chemical fertilisers annually. The government has allocated a budget of Rs 38.5 billion to provide subsidies on chemical fertilisers in the current fiscal. The government has decided to procure 331,500 metric tons of chemical fertilisers from India under the G2G provision.\n\nAlthough the ministry has claimed that the reduced subsidy on the chemical fertilisers will help curb their black marketing, it will have a negative impact on agriculture productivity, especially on paddy, wheat and maize, which are the major cereal crops.\n\nNepal grows just 40 per cent of its wheat needs, and the rest is imported, mainly from India, which also imposes a ban on its export at times when it faces a shortage in the domestic market. It is the small-scale farmers who will face the brunt of the reduced subsidy.\n\nWhat about the subsidy given on the LPG, or cooking gas, which is sold at Rs 1,800 per cylinder? The actual price of a LPG cylinder, as per Nepal Oil Corporation, stands at Rs 2,500. Nepali farmers will not be able to recoup their investment made in the agriculture sector, which is already under stress due to imports of cheap food and climate change. It will not encourage youths to take up farming as a profession.\n\nThere are some areas where subsidy can be curtailed, and the money thus saved from them can be channelised to give a boost to the agriculture sector.\n\nReducing the given subsidy on the chemical fertilisers will mean the farmers will stop growing food, and the government will have to import more food from outside by spending more from the state coffers to feed its population.\n",

        "content": "At Last, a Credible Explanation of How Kakhovka Dam Was Blown Up \n\n by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:\n\nThough Western ‘news’ media have gotten their ‘explanation’ of this event from Ukraine’s Government, it never made sense that Russia would have wanted to flood, harm, and weaken, the entire western half of the territory that Russia now controls in the former Ukraine, including in Crimea (which was getting its water-supply from that dam).\n\nThe anonymous author of the “Moon of Alabama” website has a long and almost flawless record of accurately exposing realities that mainstream U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media had been hiding, and the latest such is his June 13th “Did Russia Destroy The Nova Kakhovka Dam?” His report there turns upside-down and inside-out the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ that the dam had been bombed not by a missile, but by an explosive device which had been placed there by saboteurs whom Ukraine’s Government assumes were from Russia. U.S.-Government-approved ‘news’-media accept and amplify that assumption, but “MoA” does not.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nFirst, he quotes the New York Times and other U.S. Government mouthpieces presenting the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ of the blow-up; and then he rips it apart by noting the extremely relevant (but in U.S.-and-occupied lands ignored) fact, that on May 12th, Britain had supplied to Ukraine its “Storm Shadow” missiles that are designed to have a two-stage bombing-operation: first, a normal surface bomb, but then after it a fuse-ignited ground-penetrating bomb to explode deeper inside even a fortified and hardened underground target such as that dam was apparently blown up.\n\nThe British-supplied Storm Shadow weapon is perfect for this type of destruction — exploding from deep underground, instead of from the surface. And whereas Russia doesn’t have any Storm Shadows, Ukraine definitely does — ever since May 12th.\n\nThe present news-report about U.S.-and-allied lies is being simultaneously submitted for publication by all of the standard U.S.-Government mouthpiece propaganda-media, just in case any of them might finally want to go beyond their standard U.S.-Government-approved sources.\n\nEver since at least late 2022, Russia has been warning that Ukraine’s government wants to blow up that dam. For example, on 1 November 2022, Reuters headlined “Russia announces wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine”, and reported that,\n\n“Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,” Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message.\n\n“Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,” he said. “The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.”\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called “dirty bomb” to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. …\n\nSaldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river.\n\nEven U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media occasionally report relevant facts when they find them useful to mention in a ‘news’-report that has an anti-Russian “spin.”\n\nSo: we know that Russia’s Government was trying to protect the residents in that region against this attack, but U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media have unquestioningly accepted the Ukrainian government’s accusation that Russia’s Government did it. And, now, an extremely likely explanation has finally been provided, which implicates both Ukraine’s government and UK’s Government as having done it.",

What a joke!” some of the booing protesters shouted as Fetterman strolled by.\n\nIn his office, the senator also displays the posters of the innocent Israelis kidnapped by Hamas terrorists during their deadly raid which also killed 1,200 people.\n\n“They will stay up until every single person is safely returned home,” Fetterman noted in a video posted on X.\n\nFetterman has also argued against a cease-fire in the conflict, which has reportedly angered some of his supporters and former staffers.\n\n“Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. We must support Israel in efforts to eliminate the Hamas terrorists who slaughtered innocent men, women, and children,” the former lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania said in anOct. 18 post on X. “Hamas does not want peace, they want to destroy Israel. We can talk about a ceasefire after Hamas is neutralized.”\n\nFetterman, however, has remained a harsh critic of congressional Republican efforts to decouple US military aid for Israel from a separate aid proposal for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.\n\nOn Tuesday he called on his GOP colleagues in the upper chamber to cease efforts to pass a stand-alone Israel aid bill.\n\n“Israel and Ukraine are going through existential threats. We need to send aid to BOTH, and my Republican colleagues need to cut the crap,” Fetterman wrote on X.\n\n“This isn’t a game,” he added.",

Washington continues to throw billions of dollars into the fire of the Ukraine conflict despite its ballooning debt, Russia’s ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov has said.\n\nThe U.S. empire is becoming the laughing stock of the world over its insistence on pushing war and death for profit.

        "content": "Armistice Day and the Empire: A Name Change and the Catastrophe that Followed \n\n In 1954, the US Congress renamed Armistice Day to Veterans Day. The stated reason was to remember all generations of US veterans, not just veterans from the First World War. Congress advanced this rationale on the disingenuous notion that Armistice Day’s purpose was a celebration of veterans. It was not. Armistice Day’s purpose was to serve as a reminder of the horrors of the First World War and carry forward the declaration of those veterans of Never Again.\n\nFor a US government implementing a militarized Cold War foreign policy in 1954, a reconciliation-based holiday was inconvenient and problematic. A holiday celebrating veterans would present no critique of war or advocacy of peace; it would do the opposite. As we have seen repeatedly since 1954, Veterans Day and other aspects of “support the troops” rhetoric have been used to shout down dissent towards American wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq and suppress criticism of America’s massive overseas military empire and gargantuan Pentagon budgets. The veneration of veterans, almost always obligatorily referred to as heroes, became quasi-deification. In my life, I have seen my military service elevated to near clerical levels, reflecting a pseudo-religious treatment of America’s military caste, best exemplified by the reflexive and ritual-like statements of “thank you for your service.” The political calculus behind the name change was correct.\n\nThe militarized foreign policy of the Cold War did not just remain when the Cold War ended but became turbo-charged. The results of that militarized foreign policy have been disastrous for US national security and worldwide stability. The tremendous suffering of entire nations of people, as well as American veterans and their families, cannot be overstated.\n\nOur celebration of war that accompanies each annual Veterans Day is reflected yearlong through our politics, news media, Hollywood, and education system. The consequences of this militarization do not stop with the death and destruction from the instability and wars but include the growth of a ravenous military-industrial complex, a Leviathan, at the expense of our economy and society. With 60% of the federal discretionary budget going to the Pentagon, military contractors and to pay the costs of past wars, the opportunity costs to American communities who are told there is not enough money for healthcare, education, environmental protection and other needs are severe.\n\nThat change from Armistice Day to Veterans Day in 1954 signaled a conversion of the American government and its purposes. While the US was an empire before the Second World War, the victory in 1945 created an America that was The Empire. We have been reaping the consequences of that transformation ever since.\n\nImagine what would be now if, rather than policies derived from a jingoistic narrative of good wars and honorable slaughters, we had preceded with the wisdom of those men from 1918 and followed their admonition of Never Again. Returning to Armistice Day would not simply restore the holiday’s original name but would signal a commitment to peace, stability, prosperity, and hope for future generations. As we endure veteran suicide epidemics, bear a hollow economy and fragile communities, witness our government direct and contribute to the great and unholy carnage in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, and recognize the twin existential catastrophes of nuclear war and climate change, what Armistice Day can represent does not sound simply aspirational but entirely necessary.",

We are constantly reminded that higher electric bills are for our own good or that living with less is a moral choice. Most of us get poorer, but those who bet on carbon reduction and electric cars are making a killing.\n\nThere's a story, perhaps apocryphal, that during the siege of Stalingrad, children were given prizes of small pieces of cake for every rat they were able to catch. At the rate our civilization is going, we may be holding similar contests before too long.\n\nPolitical scientist Roger Pielke Jr. notes, \"It's quite intuitive for people to understand that there's a lot of power in solar energy. We feel the wind. The idea that you can get something for nothing, people find enormously appealing.\"\n\nExcept it's not \"something for nothing.\" And we're paying extra for \"renewable energy\" despite all the promises.\n\nCalifornia now requests all new homes to have solar panels. John Stossel points out that in addition to the solar panels, \"all new cars sold in 2035 to be zero emission, and all the state's electricity to come from carbon-free resources by 2045.\" Anyone who questions this orthodoxy is dismissed as a crank.\n\nBut the fact is that we're hurtling toward a future where our energy needs are going to far exceed our ability to supply energy at any price. The reason is that we are deliberately removing viable choices for energy creation to \"save the planet.\"\n\nCalifornia is getting results in its renewable experiments. The problem is that they're not good results and only promise to get worse.\n\nPeople in Washington state pay about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. In Oregon, 13 cents. In California, now almost 30 cents.\n\nDo they at least get reliable energy for that? No.\n\nThe big problem with wind and solar power, of course, is that they don't work when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine. Sometimes that happens when people most want heat or air conditioning.\n\nIncreased use of \"renewables\" is why blackouts are more common in California. Bloomenergy says there were over 25,000 in 2019—thousands more than the previous year.\n\n\"We failed to predict and plan,\" said Gov. Gavin Newsom. Right.\n\nInstead, they embraced unscientific green fantasies.\n\nOnly by the grace of God and flyover country voting for Republicans have we been able to avoid the fate of Californians. But the California contagion will spread unless we're more vigilant. Biden has already relaxed his electric car mandate that would have required 67% of new cars sold by 2035 to be EVs after pressure from the auto unions. But other mandates on emissions remain.\n\nThis next election will determine whether we're going to have abundant energy for our future or whether our kids will become expert rat catchers.\n",

The Danish ambassador noted that the Danish companies had adequate technologies to address climate change impacts which can collaborate with their Pakistani counterparts.\n\n“Pakistan is facing double crises; economic crisis coupled with climate change as the 2022 floods inundated one third of the country leaving millions of millions displaced and billions of dollars livestock, infrastructure and ready to harvest crops washed away,” he said. He highlighted that carbon market can be an important tool in developing right and efficient tools to benefit from latest mechanisms to cut carbon emission and address climate change but it should be considered as a financial facility alone. He said the business leaders can take the lead to influence green transition especially in the sectors of steel, fertiliser, and cement where carbon adjustment can be one tool alongwith fuel adjustment and waste management. Soren Lutken, Chief Carbon Market Special UNEP Copenhagen said carbon markets is not the only solution to climate crisis as it was not exactly the idea to reduce but shift the emissions from one place to the other.\n\nHe said Pakistan is the host of the cheaper emissions reduction mechanism whereas it was imperative to break the myth that it has missed the train to address Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). He said the country needed to come up with a clear policy framework to decide its moment to enter the compliance carbon markets. “There are cooperations available globally that are interested to buy carbon credits that needs to be explored efficiently with clear policy direction and leadership,” he said. Nadeem Nawaz, Special Advisor and Country Manager at Danish Energy Agency and Global Cooperation provided a brief presentation on the long-term energy planning strategies of Pakistan towards 2050.\n\nHe said Pakistan needs to be chalk out a credible roadmap that will lead to tempt more investors in the realm of carbon credits’ training. In his opening remarks, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI said journalists can shape public opinion and guide policymakers on adopting efficient carbon markets, whereas the think-tank and media both can benefit from each other’s experiences to reduce carbon emissions. “It is important to highlight the urgency of climate change and the critical nature of the transformative power of carbon markets as South Asia is suffering from many environmental crises,” he said.",

John Shewchuk, a certified consulting meteorologist.\n\n“NOAA fabricates temperature data for more than 30 percent of the 1,218 USHCN reporting stations that no longer exist.”\n\nHe calls them “ghost” stations.\n\nMr. Shewchuck said USHCN stations reached a maximum of 1,218 stations in 1957, but after 1990 the number of active stations began declining due to aging equipment and personnel retirements.\n\nNOAA still records data from these ghost stations by taking the temperature readings from surrounding stations, and recording their average for the ghost station, followed by an “E,” for estimate.\n\nSo much for “science.”\n\nIf you can’t prove it… just make it up.\n\nThis is from the “trust the science” fools.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston\n\nCross-posted with The Lid\n\nRelated:\n\n- Next Loony Liberal Crusade: They Want to Take Your Coffee Away — For Global Warming, Of Course (Video)\n\n- COP28 Head Tells Crowd There’s “No Science” Backing Phase-Out Of Fossil Fuels To Stop Global Warming\n\n- Norway Study Concludes There Is NO Man-Made Global Warming\n\n- Bill Gates Bankrolling DESTRUCTION OF ALL TREES To Stop “Global Warming” (Video)\n\n- Will Biden Block Sunlight To Cut Global Warming?\n\nTurn your back on Big Tech oligarchs and join the New Resistance NOW!

        "content": "Feature: Los Angeles marks Indigenous Peoples' Day with celebrations at Getty Center \n\nGetty Center, one of the top attractions in the U.S. West Coast city of Los Angeles, celebrated the annual Indigenous Peoples' Day over the weekend with an expansive family event aimed at highlighting both traditional and contemporary Indigenous perspectives.\n\nThe gathering on Saturday was part of Getty's continuous efforts to celebrate Southern California's vibrant Native American cultures. Sitting atop a hill in the Santa Monica Mountains, the Getty Center, a campus of the Getty Museum and other programs of the Getty Trust, took around 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to build and opened in December 1997. It is well known for its architecture, gardens, and bird's-eye views of Los Angeles.\n\nBuilding on last year's success, where attendees learned about native plant dyes and relished musical performances, this year's event in the museum had a broader scope.\n\nGenerous support for this year's celebration came from the Getty Patron Program, which provides funds for exceptional exhibitions at the museum, reflecting the institution's commitment to diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"Los Angeles stands on indigenous land. Recognizing Indigenous Peoples' Day is not just about acknowledgment but about understanding, appreciating, and cherishing the cultures that have been here for thousands of years,\" former Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch O'Farrell remarked previously. O'Farrell was the first Native American to serve on the Los Angeles's City Council from 2013 to 2022.\n\nIndigenous Peoples' Day is recognized on the second Monday of October, and its significance has grown over the years as an alternative to Columbus Day.\n\nRita, a teacher from Compton with Native American ancestry, attended the event with her family. \"It's essential for my children to see their culture celebrated so publicly. This is an educational experience, a cultural revival, and a family day out, all rolled into one.\"\n\nAll-day activities included a tasting menu curated by culinary anthropologist Claudia Serrato, which offered attendees a chance to savor traditional Mesoamerican flavors like cacao, chia seeds, maíz, and amaranth. Participants also received recipe cards to recreate these delicacies at home.\n\nLuna, inspired by the Alliance of Native American Chefs, attended the tasting event with an eye to learning more ways to develop her own brand of Native American cuisine that fuses her grandmother's cooking with modern flavors.\n\n\"I want to celebrate my amazing grandmother, of the Aqua Caliente tribe, who could do wonders with simple traditional ingredients, and encourage others to explore our unique culinary traditions,\" she told Xinhua.\n\nThe celebration further comprised a block stamp workshop led by Meztli Projects, where attendees learned about Mexica lifeways using linocut stamps.\n\n\"As someone deeply involved in the revival of indigenous arts, this event is a significant step forward,\" stated Carlos Red Feather, an artist from the Pacific Northwest. \"It's not just about the past; it's about the present and future of our art and our communities.\"\n\n\"I've been attending these celebrations for years, and the shift in narrative is palpable,\" Linda M., a Native American LA resident, told Xinhua. \"We appreciate the efforts of California's leaders to ensure that our voices are heard, our histories acknowledged, and our rights secured.\"\n\nThe event's broader intent was evident as it also shone light on the pressing challenges faced by Indigenous communities, such as discrimination, disproportionate impacts of climate change, and land rights.\n\nConversations echoed sentiments expressed by leaders like Alannah Hurley, executive director of United Tribes of Bristol Bay, who emphasized that the community is not merely a historical footnote but remains a crucial and vibrant part of the American fabric.\n\nAs the day ended, Mirim S., a student from the University of California, Los Angeles, reflected that \"today was more than a celebration. It was a call to action. We, the younger generation must ensure that the message of diversity and recognition is not confined to a single date but is carried on through our daily lives.\"\n\nAs Los Angeles and other cities in California and across the United States continue to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, attendees expressed the hope that it would pave the way for greater understanding, recognition and collaboration in the future.

They're really sensitive to climate action and also climate anxiety, and so this is a proactive way to really impact their world and the future, as far as making sure that we have a sustainable planet,” Monica Schultz, senior manager for DPS’s Career Navigation Services, said.\n\nNearly 40 high schoolers are taking part in the Renewable Energy Academy this year — a joint effort between DPS and nonprofit solar company GRID Alternatives Colorado.\n\n\"We've went to... workshops at GRID Alternatives... There's harnesses, things that keep you on the roof so you don't... fall off. We were pretty much learning about the safeties of... installing solar panels. And then we would also learn how to install a panel onto a roof,\" Surafel Alemayehu, one of the high schoolers taking part in the program, explained to Denver7.\n\nThe students also learned about circuitry.\n\n\"We're trying to learn more about, like how the electricity flows into the battery from the DC, the AC, the inverter and so on,\" Alemayehu said.\n\nIn addition to visiting GRID Alernatives, participants will take field trips to different renewable energy companies and solar farms across the Denver metro area.\n\n\"They get to see the industry in action through partnerships with various businesses in Denver,” Schultz said.\n\nThe whole program lasts four weeks.\n\nOnce the Renewable Energy Academy wraps up, students like Alemayehu will have the basic skills needed for an entry-level job in the industry.\n\n\"I think there's a personal aspect of it in terms of reminding their family to turn off the light when they leave a room. But then there's also the aspect of understanding the career opportunities,\" Schultz said.\n\nThis is part of a three-year grant that the City of Denver awarded DPS in 2022 for career preparation and exploration focused on green construction and sustainability.",

Russia eventually pulled its troops back from the capital of Ukraine. Sooner or later, however, the Russian forces will have to take Kyiv.\n\nIt will take the Russian forces more than just three days to take Kyiv. Interestingly, it was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, General Mark Milley, who voiced the \"Kyiv in three days” phrase a month before the start of the special operation.\n\nAccording to him, if the Russian forces go on a full-scale invasion, Kyiv will fall in 72 hours.\n\nNeither the Russian authorities nor the Russian military promised to \"take Kyiv in three days.”\n\nSome believe, however, that this could be real. The Russian army had already approached Kyiv when the West and Ukraine began negotiations and convinced Moscow to \"withdraw troops” for the talks to be effective. As always, NATO and Ukraine did not keep their promises.\n\nSince then, Kyiv has been keeping 120,000 Ukrainian troops in this direction in constant combat readiness. They did not even use any of those personnel for the defense of Avdiivka.\n\nUkraine is trying to play it safe — although it is clear that the Russian army is not going to take Kyiv without giving it a second thought.\n\nColonel Timur Syrtlanov, a special forces veteran, told Tsargrad publication that Russia would need to accomplish the following:\n\nThese are \"Putin four strikes,” by analogy with Stalin \"10 strikes.”\n\nRussia has combat experience that it gained in Chechnya and Syria, and the Russian forces will be \"tormenting” the enemy by working in a targeted manner.\n\nAs for the operation in the very beginning of the armed conflict, the attempt to come to an agreement with the Ukrainian authorities was a big mistake, political scientist Dmitry Rodionov believes. There were expectations that Zelensky would flee on day two or day three за the special military operation.\n\nThe Russian forces should have taken not only Kyiv, but also Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. As a result, the expert believes, \"intelligence errors led to gestures of goodwill that no one appreciated.”\n\nAll illusions about the nature of the special military operation have also been dispelled as well. This is not just a regional problem, but a period of global redivision of the world.\n\nThe West will drag out the conflict for as long as possible because it is benefiting from it. Meanwhile, Russia is developing cooperation with many other countries bypassing sanctions and living its own life, but no one knows how long all this is going to last.\n\nUltimate goals are as follows:\n\n\"It's time for Russia to take advantage of this circumstance. It is too early to attack Kyiv directly, but it is possible and necessary to split this society from within,” experts conclude.\n\nThe Russian forces obliterated a batch of 25,000 155-mm NATO shells in the port of Odessa. Twelve armoured vehicles (Turkey) and a warehouse of unmanned boats were also destroyed",

(”NY’s school bus dilemma: Some voters tap brakes on switch to electric vehicles,” July 29, 2024).\n\nWe 20 million New Yorkers should continue to oppose these types of programs and the rules and regulations (i.e., a gas stove ban!) that will cost each of us money but have negligible effect on climate change. Many of the 8 billion inhabitants of this planet will continue to use organic sources to cook, heat, drive and survive. They have little access to an electric infrastructure that will allow them to do otherwise.\n\nOur own infrastructure may not support the change that some envision without costly upgrades. We definitely need to be a little cautious before paying for first-class accommodations on the climate change train, as noted in an Aug. 1 Wall Street Journal commentary by Bjorn Lomborg, “Polar Bears, Dead Coral and other Climate Fictions.” It notes that many of the dire predictions promoted by the climate lobby are simply not true.\n\nRenewable energy resources are a good thing and, with time and with good policies, we will get there.

The announcement comes just two days after he claimed that the troops have successfully captured the key Ukrainian city.\n\nThe claims were however refuted by Kyiv who said that it is hanging on to a corner of the eastern Ukrainian city and that battles are ongoing.\n\n“Wagner will leave Artemovsk from May 25 to June 1,” Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio recording on Telegram.\n\nBakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed it.\n\nBefore planning the transfer of control, Prigozhin readied troops on the western outskirts of the city.\n\nHe said, “If the ministry of defence does not have enough personnel, we have thousands of generals.”\n\nPrigozhin has poured scathing criticism on Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and army chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of being incompetent and causing Moscow’s large-scale losses in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nWagner fighters have spearheaded Russia’s storming of Bakhmut and Prigozhin’s influence has risen hugely during Moscow’s Ukraine offensive.\n\nThe Russian military claimed on Saturday that it has successfully captured the much-contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.\n\nThe Wagner Group led the all-out offensive in the city.

        "content": "NYC to begin tracking food purchases to make sure residents don’t consume “too much” meat \n\n\nJust as he promised to do, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a left-wing Democrat, is going after people’s meat with new plans to save the world from “climate change” by forcing everyone to become a “plant-based” vegetarian or vegan.\n\nAlong with representatives from the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and the Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, Adams has announced the launch of a new “carbon footprint” and household food consumption tracking scheme that aims to reduce the Big Apple’s “carbon emissions” by 33 percent by the year 2030.\n\n\nIn order to cut all that carbon, Adams and his allies are imposing new “caps on meat” that, as the name suggests, will limit the amount of meat that New Yorkers are allowed to purchase and consume at public institutions – and eventually within their own homes as well.\n\n(Related: Last month, we warned you that Adams was planning to unleash a horrific new food policing apparatus against New Yorkers, and now he has.)\n\nEric Adams wants all New Yorkers to become vegans\n\nAt a pre-Earth Day event held at a Brooklyn culinary center run by NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s public health care system, Adams unveiled a chart depicting New York City’s greenhouse gas inventory. This inventory supposedly tracks the carbon footprint generated by household food consumption.\n\nWith the help of American Express, C40 Cities, and EcoData, Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption, which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use, transportation, and waste.\n\nCommissioner Rohit Aggarwala from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection unveiled the new household food consumption data. Aggarwala, by the way, also founded the Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which collects data in order to forge “a new standard for what cities have to do” as a novel way to shape policy.\n\nWhile the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas “pollution” from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing, air travel, and health care, Adams focused his efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume – mainly meat and dairy, which he personally opposes.\n\n“Food is the third-biggest source of cities’ emissions right after buildings and transportation, but all food is not created equal,” Adams unsubstantially stated. “The vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products.”\n\n“It is easy to talk about the emissions that’s coming from buildings and how it impacts our environment, but we now have to talk about beef. And I don’t know if people are ready for this conversation.”\n\nOther than fish, Adams reportedly abides by a “plant-based” vegan diet, which he says helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices, which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop “global warming.”\n\n“We already know that a plant-powered diet is better for your physical and mental health, and I am living proof of that,” Adams declared. “But the reality is that thanks to this new inventory, we’re finding out it is better for the planet.”\n\nThe simplistic way in which Adams couched his argument against meat and dairy has already been debunked by people who are actually educated in such things, including Melissa McKendree, PhD, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University.\n\n“Different meats have different kinds of greenhouse gas footprints,” McKendree clarified about how pasture-raised animals do not harm the environment like feedlot animals do. “All land is not created equal.”",

On Wednesday, at an Edmonton, Alberta news conference, she condemned a fellow-progressive, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that “people shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking Liberals,” and accused him of “betraying” the Paris climate agreement.\n\nFonda claimed that, like President Barack Obama, her first impression of Trudeau was one of admiration: “When I heard that your prime minister, the shining hope at the … Paris climate talks, who talked so beautifully about needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty, and respect and hold to the treaties with the Indigenous people, and so forth — such a heroic stance he took there,” Fonda said. “And yet he has betrayed every one of the things that he committed to in Paris.\n\n“I guess the lesson is we shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking liberals, no matter how well spoken they are. What a disappointment.”\n\nBut there was disappointment in the remarks of Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, who leads the left-leaning provincial New Democratic Party. She called Fonda “tone deaf” and “ill-informed.”\n\nFonda received an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands but she refused.\n\n“I would suggest if someone was going to come to Alberta … [and] fly over a city that is going through a significant economic downturn, that’s just been through the largest natural disaster in the history of Canada, and then lecture them about where they should get jobs elsewhere, first of all, that’s super tone deaf,” Notley said.\n\nOn the first day of her oil sands protest, as she strolled through nearby Fort McMurray, Fonda was ambushed by social media reporter Robbie Picard.\n\nPicard, who hosts the Facebook group OilSands Strong, peppered Fonda with questions about the oil sands, asking her if she was aware of how many First Nations businesses have invested money in the project.\n\nThe episode was captured on video by a CBC journalist who was attempting to interview the actress. Fonda did not address any of the questions but insisted, “I’m on your side.”",

        "content": "The Fed’s Climate Studies Are Full Of Hot Air \n\n The Federal Reserve’s credibility is in tatters.\n\nIt predicted low inflation through 2021 even as the money supply exploded and higher inflation followed. To catch up, it quickly raised interest rates, stressing many banks, and Fed examiners failed to act before depositors noticed that Silicon Valley Bank was insolvent.\n\nThe result was bank runs and panic. But instead of lowering inflation and preventing recession, many of the Fed’s 400 economists are busy fighting climate change. [emphasis, links added]\n\nExamples of climate activism abound.\n\nThis year the Fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports on their climate vulnerability in a “pilot project” that is sure to expand and might lead to lending restrictions.\n\nA query of the Fed’s listing of recent publications returns hundreds of research papers, press releases, and policy statements related to climate change. The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May, in which 27 Fed economists participated.\n\nWith all this effort, one might hope the Fed would produce high-quality research on climate change. But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis.\n\nThese studies on the effect of temperature on U.S. and world economic growth are cited without a hint of skepticism and widely lavished with media attention. I’ve managed to debunk both.\n\nIn the September issue of Econ Journal Watch, I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S.\n\nI showed that the paper had serious problems with its statistical reasoning and robustness. My analysis concluded that the data used in the paper showed no meaningful relationship between temperatures and growth.\n\nMore recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above-normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely.\n\nThe original study used sophisticated statistical techniques but failed to report that its primary finding was statistically insignificant. My request to the study’s author for computer code to reproduce the paper’s results went unanswered.\n\nI managed to write the code from scratch and exactly replicate the results, allowing me to run additional tests that the author didn’t report.\n\nThe author’s primary result—that temperature has a bigger effect in bad than in good economic times—turned out to be statistically insignificant. Additional analysis showed that there is no reliable effect of temperature on growth at all.\n\nThere are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth. First, each country in the sample had equal weight in the analysis.\n\nChina had the same weight as St. Vincent though China’s population is 13,000 times as large. Equal weighting means that some small countries with unusual histories of economic growth greatly influenced the results.\n\nThe paper’s results disappeared when countries like Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea—which had economic catastrophes and bonanzas unrelated to climate change—were omitted.\n\nOmitting similar countries representing less than 1% of the world’s gross domestic product was enough to eliminate the paper’s result. The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries.\n\nThere’s a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth: Many poor countries have warm climates.\n\nA warm climate doesn’t preclude economic growth, as is demonstrated by Florida, Arizona, Taiwan, Singapore, and several Persian Gulf states. But the average poor country is warmer than the average rich country.\n\nDebate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal, but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year-to-year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth.\n\nThe paper claims that its method controls for long-term differences in climate, but using simulated data I found that the Fed paper’s method can be fooled into finding an effect that doesn’t exist.\n\nThe only thing to learn from the Fed’s research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast, and when it comes to climate, academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts.\n\nThe Fed’s time would be better spent on more urgent matters, like improving its botched regulation of the banking system.\n\nh/t Steve B.\n\nRead more at WSJ\n\nJoin our list\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.",

The truth, though, is that Antarctica’s ice shelves are actually growing in size.\n\nNew research published by Andreasen et al. looks at Antarctic-wide satellite data collected between 2009 and 2019. The data was compiled using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nBetween the 10-year period analyzed, Andreasen et al. discovered that the Antarctic ice shelf area grew in size by 5305 km2. Eighteen ice shelves did retreated in size somewhat during that time, but 16 others grew larger in terms of their overall area mass.\n\n“Our observations show that Antarctic ice shelves gained 661 Gt of ice mass over the past decade,” the researchers noted in their paper.\n\n(Related: When the next “catastrophe” strikes, climate-related or otherwise, Erie County, N.Y., is ready to impose more lockdowns – only “essential workers” with “movement passes” will be allowed to travel.)\n\nNumerous studies confirm: Antarctic ice is doing just fine\n\nAnother study published by Banwell et al. that appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters looked at an even wider range of Antarctic ice data ranging from 1980 through 2021. That study utilized microwave satellite data from the snow model SNOWPACK.\n\nLike the first study, this second one, which was published in 2023, found that the highest meltwater volumes occurred on Antarctica’s Peninsula, reaching a peak in 1992 and 1993, as well as in 1994 and 1995. SNOWPACK calculated “a small, but significant, decreasing trend in both annual melt days and meltwater production volume over the 41 years.”\n\nAnother paper published by Frazer et al. in the journal Nature backs these findings even further. This one explains that while dramatic ice losses are occurring in some areas of Antarctica, including in West Antarctica from Pine Island and the Thwaites glaciers, ice projections for the future cannot be accurately made.\n\nThis study, which looked at a time period ranging from 2003 through 2015, identified extensive glacial retreat and acceleration along the Bellinghausen Sea coastline. Conversely, things look rather well on the ice front along the Amundsen Sea.\n\n“Our results provide direct observations that the pace, magnitude and extent of ice destabilization around West Antarctica vary by location, with the Amundsen Sea response most sensitive to interdecadal atmosphere-ocean variability,” the authors wrote.\n\nFinally, another paper published by Baico et al., also in 2023, found that over the centuries, Antarctic ice has both thinned and thickened, depending on the time period.\n\nThe authors looked at subglacial bedrock cores to discover that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) between the Thwaites and Pope glaciers “was at least 35 m (meters) thinner than present in the past several thousand years and then subsequently thickened.”",

Savor, backed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates, said that its experiments with creating diary-free alternatives to ice-cream, cheese, and milk have produced a new animal-free butter alternative.

In contrast, real unsalted butter with 80% fat has a standard climate footprint of 16.9kg CO2 equivalent per kg.\n\nKathleen Alexander, Savor’s chief executive, said, “We are currently pre-commercial and working through regulatory approval to be able to sell our butter. We are not expecting to be able to move forward with any kind of sales until at least 2025. So far, we had informal taste panels with tens of people. We expect to perform a more formal panel as part of our commercialisation and scale-up efforts.”\n\nRead more: Elon Musk warns Bill Gates: You will be ‘obliterated’ if you do this to Tesla stock\n\nBacking the initiative in an online blogpost, Bill Gates wrote, “The idea of switching to lab-made fats and oils may seem strange at first.

By harnessing proven technologies and processes, we get one step closer to achieving our climate goals.\"\n\nRead more: Melinda French Gates on divorce from Bill Gates: 'There wasn't enough trust'\n\nHe added, “The process doesn’t release any greenhouse gases, and it uses no farmland and less than a thousandth of the water that traditional agriculture does.

It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.” ( – Joseph Toomey, below)\n\nTalented amateurs are often better than the ‘professionals’ when it comes to dissecting U.S. energy policy. Or maybe I have it reversed. The pros are those in the trenches and the amateurs are the ones on high.\n\nSo let’s call Joseph Toomey, independent management consultant, an expert. Here is his recent post about the much-in-the-news problems of the offshore wind industry under Biden Energy Policy.\n\nNot long ago, this thread reiterated a resolute, long-standing belief that Offshore Wind is neither practical nor affordable, even in high-tax Democrat-governed Blue States of the U.S. Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions. Four proposed Offshore Wind projects had collapsed into miserable failure after project sponsors demanded increased public subsidies of as much as 65% above the already wildly-inflated feed-in prices they had previously been promised by New York State.\n\nJust this week, it was New Jersey’s turn to be left looking like adolescents for pretending that Offshore Wind could ever become a viable option for supplying the electricity needs of that state’s ratepayers at affordable levels.\n\nNote the delicious fury from New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy who proclaimed that:\n\n“Today’s decision by Ørsted to abandon its commitments to New Jersey is outrageous and calls into question the company’s credibility and competence.”\n\nIt was Murphy himself whose competence had been called into question by backing these wildly infeasible ideas.\n\nIf this sounds a little too much like a “Spike the Football” moment for our valuable readership, you have my deepest condolences. I just fell off my armchair laughing at the hilarious incompetence of our renewable energy-promoting political class. The day can’t come soon enough when real adults return into leadership positions to pull humanity back from the brink of extinction events that actually exist, as recent troubling global developments adequately demonstrate.\n\nThe Biden administration’s preposterous plan to establish 30,000 megawatts of nameplate Offshore Wind capacity by 2030 was always a pipedream. It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.\n\nThe badly-needed adult supervision delivered by marketplace realities has now demonstrated to sentient humans that there was never a chance in the whole universe that Biden’s absurd plan could ever be realized.\n\nActivate to view larger image,\n\nComments on Post\n\nSome of the many comments that followed either confirmed the obvious or suggested the way forward.\n\nThe obvious from Robert Borlick: “Notice how many days with no output? This is why wind needs to be backed up with dependable generators that can be ramped up to serve the load.”\n\nThe way forward from Ken Urkosky: “All this subsidy funding should go to building infrastructure capable of withstanding the harsher weather events we’re told to expect! That would be much more effective in reducing the impacts of climate change vs trying to control our Earth’s climate.”\n\nAnd Borlick, an important voice in the electricity debate, has had enough with offshore wind:\n\nI strongly opposed the OSW projects that were approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission in 2017 and again in 2021. Both awards violated Maryland law by not conducting valid cost-benefit analyses, which would have eliminated all but one project (US Wind). I tried to persuade the Maryland People’s Counsel to sue the MPSC but they wimped out – both times.\n\nNow the crazies in the Maryland legislature want to approve even more OSW but this time they want to hide the huge subsidies by paying them out of general tax revenues, instead of through the more visible electricity rate increases.\n\nMy hope is that cost increases will kill the Maryland projects just as they did the New Jersey projects.\n\nThe last word goes to engineer Greg Gardner: “BUT, it made a lot of congresspersons rich… that was the real plan.”",

However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.\n\nThis is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive \"showed the cowardice of the allies,\" especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nSir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.\n\n\"The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?\" asks the colonel.\n\nAccording to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, \"the most pathetic were the Western allies\" who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, \"but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation.\" And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft \"was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.\"\n\nIncidentally, it was these fears and the \"miserable policy\" of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.\n\n\"Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,\" the colonel said.\n\n\"What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,\" Sir Richard Kemp said.\n\nUkraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a \"salutary lesson,\" the military said.\n\n\"Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,\" the British colonel believes.\n\nOnly verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber.

Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also the CPC chairwoman, from deflecting some heat toward GOP leadership.\n\n\"Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader McCarthy threatening an end to aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over,\" said Jayapal, referring to recent remarks from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., pledging that a GOP-controlled House would not give a \"blank check\" to Ukraine.\n\n",

        "content": "Energy transition opens new vistas for solar, wind power companies \n\n by Xinhua writer Shi Hao\n\nBEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Over the past three months, Anhui Huasun Energy Co., Ltd. has been racing against time to make solar modules for a gigantic photovoltaic project in China's Xinjiang.\n\nThese 1.8-gigawatt modules using advanced heterojunction technology will be installed at a 4-gigawatt solar power plant, which is located on the edge of China's largest desert, the Taklimakan.\n\n\"For Chinese companies in the photovoltaic industry more than 20 years ago, raw materials, technologies and markets relied heavily on foreign countries and regions. But now, the tide has totally turned,\" Huasun's chairman Xu Xiaohua said.\n\nIn east China's Anhui Province, where Xu's company is based, the photovoltaic industry has snowballed in the past five years. The number of companies in the business with an annual revenue exceeding 10 billion yuan (about 1.43 billion U.S. dollars) rose to 11 in 2023.\n\nThe boom, which is also recorded beyond Anhui, is underpinned by China's vigorous efforts to expedite a comprehensive transition to green growth as tasks remain daunting.\n\nChina aims to raise the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption to around 25 percent of total energy consumption by 2030, which means the country must make every effort to increase the ratio by one percentage point annually in the next few years.\n\n\"The proportion of coal consumption in China's total energy consumption stood at 55.3 percent in 2023, and thus the potential for green and low-carbon energy transition is great,\" said Li Zheng, director of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University.\n\nChina is already revving up the transition to green energy. Official data released this week showed that the installed capacity of solar power came in at approximately 750 million kilowatts in the first eight months of 2024, rocketing 48.8 percent year on year, and the installed capacity of wind power grew 19.9 percent to some 470 million kilowatts.\n\nPan Huimin, deputy head of the National Energy Administration's new and renewable energy department, said the rapid development of the new energy sector in recent years resulted from full market competition, a sound business environment, constant tech innovation and a complete industrial chain.\n\nTo meet the requirement of exports and foster green industrial and supply chains, Chinese enterprises' demand for clean electricity is experiencing \"explosive growth,\" Pan said in the latest episode of the China Economic Roundtable, an all-media talk platform hosted by Xinhua. The new episode was broadcast Friday.\n\nA key challenge is fully harnessing unstable wind and sunlight and transmitting power to users, often hundreds or thousands of kilometers away.\n\nLast month, users in Beijing started receiving solar and wind power generated in the northwestern province of Gansu after the energy was delivered via extra-high-voltage transmission lines, benefiting Gansu companies in the business and meeting the Chinese capital's demand for green energy.\n\nChina unveiled an action plan last month to speed up building a \"new electricity system.\" According to the document, Chinese authorities will use advanced power generation, regulation and control technologies to increase the transmission of clean electricity through the grid.\n\nLocal governments and enterprises should seize opportunities and vigorously exploit wind and solar power in line with local resources and with the capabilities of the grid to absorb the generated electricity, Pan said. ■",

The Kharkiv region in northeastern Ukraine has been a focal point for renewed fighting in recent weeks.\n\n“Kharkiv’s printing houses produce a significant percentage of all books in Ukraine, including textbooks for Ukrainian children. By striking these printing houses, Russia is attacking Ukraine’s education system. We will not let Russia succeed,” Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nThe White House official said the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will assist Ukraine in printing more than 3 million textbooks for elementary school students in the country ahead of the next school year. Mr. Sullivan said this textbook production effort will take place inside Ukraine and that the finished books will be distributed to more than 12,000 schools around the country.\n\n“Our message is clear: We will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend against Russia’s barbaric war of aggression,” Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nHe didn’t specify how much the textbook production run would cost, from where USAID would draw the funds, or where the new production efforts would take place to avoid additional disruptions from Russian attacks. The Epoch Times reached out to both the White House and USAID for further comment but didn’t receive a response from either by press time.\n\nThe U.S. government has designated some $173 billion for direct and indirect aid to Ukraine since Russian forces launched their large-scale military campaign there in February 2022, most recently allocating about $60 billion for Ukraine in a foreign aid supplemental that Congress passed in April. While much of the U.S. support for Ukraine has been in the form of shipments of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment to assist in the fighting, Ukraine also has received humanitarian aid and direct financial support.",

Presidential envoys from the four countries already met in Paris on Wednesday and agreed to another meeting in Berlin in two weeks.\n\nThe latest diplomatic move also comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday called on the West not to create “panic,” challenging U.S. warnings about an imminent Russian attack.\n\n“I don’t consider the situation now tenser than before. There is a feeling abroad that there is war here. That’s not the case,” Zelensky told reporters at a Friday press briefing. “We don’t need this panic,” he added.\n\nZelensky’s comment comes one day after rumors spread that President Joe Biden warned him during a phone call that Kyiv would soon be “sacked” in an invasion by Russian military forces.\n\n“He has previously said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko also ruled out that there will be war, saying there will not be a war unless Belarus or Russia comes under attack.\n\n“The leaders of some countries have gone mad, they think they can win that war,” Lukashenko said. “But there will be no victory, we will all lose.”\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament the number of Russian troops near Ukraine—which amounts to about 130,000—is comparable to Moscow’s military buildup last spring, when Moscow eventually pulled its forces back after massive exercises.\n\n“We haven’t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring,” with the exception of the deployment to Belarus, Reznikov said.\n\nWhile Moscow and the West are mulling their next steps, NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the United States ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe.\n\nRussia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops have also headed to Belarus for sweeping joint drills, again raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north.",

As things stand today, the United States has not adjusted our nuclear posture, but it is something that we monitor day by day, hour by hour, because it is a paramount priority to the president.”\n\nWhen asked if the Biden administration was “concerned” about the situation, Sullivan said, “Anytime you have a nuclear power fighting in a conflict zone in Europe near NATO territory, of course we have to focus on and be concerned about the possibility of escalation, the risk of escalation.”\n\nHowever, Sullivan again doubled down on his previous comment that officials “have not seen anything that would require us to change our nuclear posture at this time.”\n\nWithin days of invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert, blaming the “hostile actions” and statements of Western nations and NATO.\n\n“Western countries are not only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic area. I’m speaking about the illegitimate sanctions that everyone is well aware of. However, the top officials of the leading NATO countries also make aggressive statements against our country as well,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top ministers.\n\nAs a result, Putin said that he has ordered “the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.”\n\nThe deterrence forces include command of Russia’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, although it is unclear what a “special mode of combat duty” refers to.\n\nPutin’s order means that Russia’s nuclear weapons are prepared for the increased possibility of launch, raising the possibility that Western nations could be subject to nuclear strikes if they get too involved in the Ukraine conflict.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 9 called Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine–Russia conflict a “bluff.”\n\nOn March 13, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators said that there had been progress in talks between both sides regarding a potential end to the conflict.\n\nThe Kyiv government is continuing to demand an “end of the war and the withdrawal of [Russian] troops,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, wrote on Twitter, adding that he believes Ukraine will “achieve some results literally in a matter of days.”\n\nWhile both sides appear to be optimistic about the potential to end the more than two-week-long conflict, no further details were provided.",

It was published by weather forecaster and climate science denier Joe Bastardi. Both Bastardi and Maue work for WeatherBELL Analytics, a private weather consulting firm.\n\nScreenshot of GWPF tweets taken on August 14 2017.\n\nThanks for acknowledging this Benny. Are you could to delete the original tweet so that this erroneous claim doesn’t spread further?\n\n— Ed Hawkins (@ed_hawkins) August 13, 2017\n\nIndeed. My bias, my mistake.\n\n— GWPF (@thegwpfcom) August 13, 2017\n\nAs a number of climate scientists have been quick to point out, Lawson was wrong to claim that the average global temperature has “slightly declined” since 2007. In fact, the global surface temperature over this period has risen, with the three hottest years on record occurring in 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\nIn addition to being a reaction to those debunking the graph’s false and misleading claims, the GWPF’s efforts to distance themselves from the inaccurate data comes one day after neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer featured a story using the same graph with the headline “It’s Colder Now Than When Al Gore Won the Nobel Prize for Kook Theory in 2007”.\n\nHeaded over to Daily Stormer to see just how bad the #charlottesville Nazi’s site is.

She is not a trusted source of information but rather a Deep State puppet who pushes propaganda unsuccessfully. Yellen wants you to believe that America’s economy is stronger than ever with unlimited funds for all besides the actual citizens who pay taxes.\n\n\nWhen asked if America could fund two major wars, Yellen told Sky News, “Absolutely!”.\n\n“America can certainly afford to stand with Israel and to support Israel’s military needs, and we also can and must support Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The American economy is doing extremely well,” Yellen said.\n\nThe US national debt is now at $33.56 trillion with a defense budget of around $800 billion. We are funding layaway wars with no intention of ever paying back a penny to our debtors. They may strategize war, but they’re not strategizing war from an economic standpoint.\n\nChina was the largest purchaser of US debt but they have been abandoning US debt and the dollar entirely.\n\nYellen called the US debt downgrade “arbitrary” when Fitch Ratings downgraded US long-term debt late from AAA to AA+. The agency cited the debt ceiling negotiations and frequent government shutdowns as one of the reasons for the downgrade, and this was prior to the US losing its Speaker of the House for the first time in history.\n\nAnother reason is simply that China is disinvesting in the dollar.\n\nThe $2 billion sent to Israel is merely the beginning since the full-scale war has not yet begun. The two wars will merge into one when other nations become involved.\n\nIsrael could easily defeat Palestine on its own without foreign aid. But once the major players like China and Russia intervene it will take the full force and funding of NATO.\n\nWar has become the #1 economic priority for America’s politicians. “We” do not want to fund any wars but have no say in the matter since the elections are rigged, the data is inaccurate, and the truth is concealed by lie after lie.\n",

Feel free to repost and share widely Global Research articles.\n\nIn a recently unearthed video of the College of Global Public Health Center for Bioethics at New York University Director, Dr. Matthew Liao, speaking at the 2016 World Science Festival, he openly advocates artificially inducing a red meat allergy in the entire human population, using an analog of the algha-gal molecule found in the Lone Star Tick that I have documented previously at Armageddon Prose, so as to fight “climate change.”\n\n\n“People eat too much meat. And if they were to cut down on their consumption on meat, then it would actually really help the planet.\n\nBut people are not willing to give up meat. Some people will be willing to, but other people – they may be willing to but they have a weakness of will. They say ‘this steak is just too juicy, I can’t do that.’ I’m one of those by the way.\n\nSo here’s a thought. So it turns out that we know a lot about — we have these intolerances… For example, I have a milk intolerance. And some people are intolerant to crayfish. So possibly we can use human engineering to make the case that we’re intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds of bovine proteins…\n\nThere’s this thing called the Lone Star tick where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat… So that’s something we can do through human engineering. We can possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.”\n\nThis level of evil – openly plotting to trigger autoimmune disease in humans without their consent at the population level – is nearly unspeakable.\n\nAt the same forum, Liao advocated “editing” humans to become “so small that we get eaten by cats,” again for the sake of “climate change.”\n\nWere these psychopaths to succeed with this and any of their many other bioengineering projects under the guises of Public Health™, fighting “climate change,” etc., then nothing the Third Reich did, or even fantasized doing in Dr. Mengele’s wildest dreams, to the undesirables would remotely compare.\n\nThis is a war – of a different kind than we have seen historically – “unrestricted warfare,” as the CCP calls it — but a war nonetheless. As such, we need Nuremberg II now. People like Matthew Liao are not civilians; they must be reclassified as enemy combatants and given military tribunal trials.\n\nI don’t know how this is going to be politically feasible, given the highly controlled and totally compromised political machine in the US and across the West, “penetrated” by the WEF, in the words of Klaus Schwab, as they are.\n",

        "content": "European leader calls on world, China to pressure Russia \n\n NUSA DUA – The European Council president urged global powers Tuesday to intensify pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine, including Moscow's biggest supporter, China, saying that this week's meeting of the world's largest economies was crucial to stopping Moscow's push \"to use food and energy as weapons.”\n\nCharles Michel, speaking to reporters on the first day of the Group of 20 meeting in Bali, said the nine-month war waged by Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has disrupted lives across the world, as food and energy prices surge and economies stagnate.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n“Russia’s war impacts us all, no matter where we live, from Europe to Africa or the Middle East, and the single best way to end the acute crisis in food and energy is for Russia to end this senseless war and to respect the U.N. charter,” Michel said. “The Kremlin has decided to weaponize food, driving up hunger, poverty and instability.”\n\nEurope, Michel said, is working to help Ukraine, a big food exporter before the war, increase its shipments, and is also trying to address disruptions in fertilizer supplies and rising prices. EU sanctions against Russia, he said, don’t target agricultural products, even though Russia has imposed restrictions on its own food and fertilizer products.\n\n“This is not a battle (of) Russia against the Western part of the world. It’s a battle for the U.N. charter. It’s a battle for the international law. It's a battle for the idea that this is not acceptable to try to change by force internationally recognized borders.”\n\nMichel said he had no plans to meet with the most senior Russian present in Bali, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\nChina, the world's second biggest economy, has largely refrained from public criticism of Russia’s war, although Beijing has avoided direct support of the Russians, such as supplying arms. Michel avoided direct criticism of China when asked if Beijing has shown any signs of changing its steadfast support of Russia in recent days.\n\nInstead, he said that the G-20 meeting Tuesday and Wednesday was important to convince all nations present “to put more pressure on Russia.\"\n\nAfter a meeting Monday between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden said the two leaders discussed Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and “reaffirmed our shared belief” that the use or even the threat of nuclear weapons is “totally unacceptable” — a reference to Moscow’s thinly veiled threats to use atomic weapons as its invasion of Ukraine has faltered.\n\nMichel said that Europe must make sure that it creates a different economic and political relationship with China than the one it did with Russia.\n\n“We don't want to make the same mistakes maybe we make with Russia on fossil fuels,” which Europe was very dependent on, “with China, (where) we don't want to be too dependent for the innovative technology that we need today and that we need more in the future. That's why it's important to rebalance the relationship,” Michel said.",

The West will put pressure on Kiev, calling for an end to the conflict, even if US presidential candidate Donald Trump loses the election. This was reported by the Financial Times (FT) newspaper.\n\nAccording to her, Kiev knows that it will be under increasing pressure to achieve negotiations on ending the conflict. And this will happen regardless of whether Trump wins the election, the publication emphasizes.\n\nThe former US president has repeatedly stated that he is able to achieve peace in Ukraine overnight, but did not specify exactly how. But several of his former officials and advisers have suggested that this could include an unofficial cession of territory in exchange for meaningful Western security guarantees for Kiev, writes FT.\n\nUkraine and several of its European allies are concerned about this course of events, but with the current level of Western military support and internal mobilization of Ukraine's resources, Kiev has no viable path to victory, the publication emphasizes. Europe has no desire to step up its efforts. Although the Europeans \"recognize\" that more will have to be done to arm Ukraine, \"there is no substantive discussion of options,\" the FT quoted a senior European official as saying.\n\nOn June 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting with the leadership of the Foreign Ministry, named the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine. Among them are the withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) from Donbass and Novorossiya, Kiev's refusal to join NATO. In addition, Russia considers it necessary to lift all Western sanctions against it and establish Ukraine's non-aligned and nuclear-free status. Kiev rejected the Russian peace plan. After the massive attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Kursk region, which began on August 6, the Russian leader said that negotiations with the government attacking civilians were pointless.",

At least two U.S. citizens arrested in Russia in recent years — including WNBA star Brittney Griner — have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the United States.\n\nIn December, the U.S. State Department said it had made a significant offer to secure the release ofGershkovich and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges, that it said Moscow had rejected.\n\nOfficials did not describe the offer, although Russia has been said to be seeking the release of Vadim Krasikov, who was given a life sentence in Germany in 2021 for the killing in Berlin of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.\n\nA Russian court extends the pretrial detention for American reporter accused of spying\n\nA court in Moscow ruled to keep Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in custody pending his trial on espionage charges.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, asked this year about releasing Gershkovich, appeared to refer to Krasikov by pointing to a man imprisoned by a U.S. ally for “liquidating a bandit” who had allegedly killed Russian soldiers during separatist fighting in Chechnya.\n\nBeyond that hint, Russian officials have kept mum about the talks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeatedly said that while “certain contacts” on swaps continue, “they must be carried out in absolute silence.”\n\nGershkovich is the first U.S. reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Daniloff was released 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union’s United Nations mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges.",

A red environmental impact stamp placed on beef led to a quarter more people abstaining, compared to those who did not see the warning.\n\nEnvironmental guilt was more effective than the green \"good for the planet\" label, which encouraged only a tenth more people to choose more sustainable food.\n\nBritish consumers already are used to the \"traffic-light\" good labels for those with more than the recommended fat, sugar, or salt.\n\nA new group of American researchers is testing adding a similar system to combat climate change, among other things.\n\nTheir study, published in JAMA Network Open, claims it could have merit because animal-based food production, primarily through beef, accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThey tested it by enrolling over 5,000 participants putting them in three groups, and showing them a fast-food menu.\n\nThey had to select one item from the hypothetical 14 that had affixed labels from a red food lkabel stating, \"This item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change,\" to green one which read, \"This item is environmentally sustainable. It has low greenhouse gas emissions and a low contribution to climate change.\"\n\nThe study found red labels to be the most effective at 23.5% more than the comparative choosing nonbeef in the control group.\n\nOnly 10% of people chose green, compared to the control group.\n\nThe lead author of the study, professor Julia Wolfson, an expert in food policy at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the results showed an effectiveness with the red-style labeling.\n\n\"We found that labeling red meat items with negatively framed, red high–climate impact labels was more effective at increasing sustainable selections than labeling non-red meat items with positively framed, green low–climate impact labels,\" she said.\n\nWolfson added those who were likely to choose green labels tended to eat healthier than the control. This is despite no fast food included on the menu.\n\nShe said regardless of its effectiveness, governments would need to enforce it by law.\n\n\"It is unlikely that industry would voluntarily adopt a negatively framed label approach; such an approach may need to be mandated or incentivized via legislation or regulation,\" Wolfson said.\n\n ",

In addition to infrastructure development, the DEB program also empowers communities in accelerating energy equity by utilizing local energy sources to deliver power to remote villages.\n\nPertamina vice president corporate communication Fadjar Djoko Santoso said Pertamina would continue to provide access to renewables for all Indonesians so they ultimately achieved energy and economic self-reliance.\n\n\"We are continuing our journey to provide opportunities and accelerate the energy transition for the public, such as through the DEB program, which can be beneficial in stimulating economic activity,\" Fadjar said.\n\nTasikharjo village is one tangible example of Pertamina’s support for local economies through the DEB program. The village is using solar energy to power local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), such as Batik Sekar Tanjung, Jahit Sekar Tanjung and Ethical Creative Tasikharjo.\n\nMeanwhile, Tambakharjo subdistrict is using solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to power the activities of the Pujasera Energy Culinary Kampung.\n\nSolar energy is also being harnessed to support a variety of activities in Kedonganan village that impact the region’s community-based economy, including the operation of its reduce, reuse, recycle waste management facility (TPS3R).\n\nSolar PV panels is also used to generate renewable energy in the villages of Eka Jaya, Larangan and Singapure to support the activities of aquaponics, aquaculture and agriculture MSMEs, including a coffee farm, as well as other MSMEs that stimulate economic and social development.\n\n\"The use of renewable and environmentally friendly energy, which never runs out, greatly enhances the productivity of coffee bean processing and other business production, early childhood schools and other public institutions, such as Posyandu [integrated health services posts],” said Singapure village head Aristo Hasan.\n\n“This improves the quality of life for residents of Singapure village and also broadens our understanding of environmentally friendly, renewable energy that can help the government mitigate climate change,\" Aristo added.\n\nSince Pertamina launched the DEB program in 2019, the program has generated benefits that include 170,880 watt-peak (Wp) of solar energy, 605,000 cubic meters per year of biogas and methane, 8,000 Wp of microhydropower, 6,500 liters of biodiesel per year and 16,500 Wp of solar-wind hybrid energy.\n\nIn addition to its energy impact, the DEB program has also positively impacted 3,201 households, contributing to an estimate of Rp 1.8 billion in added value per year through overall multiplier effect. The program has also contributed to reducing carbon emissions by 565,928 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) per year.\n\nAs part of Pertamina’s CSER initiative, the DEB program supports the company's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles. The program is also in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in achieving SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 13 on Climate Action.\n\nMoreover, the DEB program is a concrete action Pertamina is taking to contribute to the government's 2060 net zero emissions goal.\n\nShare your experiences, suggestions, and any issues you've encountered on The Jakarta Post.

        "content": "Why the Media Don’t Want to Know the Truth About the Nord Stream Blasts \n\n by Jonathan Cook, The Unz Review:\n\nNo one but the terminally naïve should be surprised that security services lie – and that they are all but certain to cover their tracks when they carry out operations that either violate domestic or international law or that would be near-universally rejected by their own populations.\n\nWhich is reason enough why anyone following the fallout from explosions last September that ripped holes in three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea supplying Russian gas to Europe should be wary of accepting anything Western agencies have to say on the matter.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nIn fact, the only thing that Western publics should trust is the consensus among “investigators” that the three simultaneous blasts deep underwater on the pipelines – a fourth charge apparently failed to detonate – were sabotage, not some freak coincidental accident.\n\nSomeone blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, creating an untold environmental catastrophe as the pipes leaked huge quantities of methane, a supremely active global-warming gas. It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.\n\nIf Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to “weaken” Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.\n\nBut, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.\n\nNot only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.\n\nBut even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.\n\nInstead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.\n\nWhen the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its “national security.”\n\nNo one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.\n\nIsolated and friendless\n\nIt might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself.",

The site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on Sunday during the extended 45th session of the World Heritage Committee ongoing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nWith the addition of this new listing, China's number of UNESCO World Heritage sites has risen to 57. The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er is the very first tea-themed world cultural heritage site globally.\n\nOn what makes this site stand out and on what sort of cultural insights it offers, Li said the cultural landscape comprises five ancient tea forests, nine traditional villages and three protective forests, which maintain their vitality to this day.\n\n\"According to archaeological findings, the cultivation of tea trees in ancient China can be traced back over 6,000 years,\" Li said. \"Subsequently, tea culture and the practice of growing and consuming tea spread from China to neighboring countries and beyond.\"\n\nThe cultural landscape has resulted in a unique protection system combining government management with grassroots governance, which ensures the protection of cultural and biological diversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, Li said.\n\nThis heritage, he said, also demonstrates the unique tradition of the complementary use of natural resources in mountainous environments by many of China's ethnic groups.\n\nIts success in achieving World Heritage Site status is \"a significant achievement in presenting an authentic picture of ancient and modern China to the world,\" the official said.\n\nChina plans to implement preservation and management initiatives in five key areas, Li said.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of prioritizing protection and planning ahead, Li highlighted the need for the coordinated planning of protection and management measures for ancient tea forests, villages and traditional residential architecture. Such an approach aims to strike a balance between heritage preservation and development.\n\nFurthermore, China intends to invest in research on core technologies to enhance its monitoring capabilities for ancient tea forests as well as rare flora and rare fauna, and its capabilities for climate change responses.\n\nTo promote the sustainable development of its heritage sites, China aims to improve the participation mechanism for locals and other stakeholders. The involvement of local communities, particularly people from younger generations, will be encouraged and guided to contribute to the dissemination of tea culture and the growth of the tea industry.\n\nChina will continue to delve into the history of the tea industry, explore the philosophical depth of tea culture, and elucidate the global influence of Chinese tea culture. The country seeks to tap into the value of this heritage and promote its traditional culture further.\n\nThe official said that efforts are underway to promote the effective utilization and regulated development of cultural World Heritage Sites, aiming to breathe new life into these invaluable treasures. ■",

In the capital Berlin, for example, the main traffic circle around the Victory Column was blocked in this way.\n\nThe activists accuse the government of \"breaking its own climate law,\" arguing that the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) refused to present an emergency climate protection program as required by German law.\n\nWhile Germany met its overall emission reduction target in 2022, the transport sector slightly increased its emissions compared to the previous year, according to the Federal Environment Agency (UBA).\n\nInternationally, transport is also failing to deliver on climate change mitigation, as global decarbonization measures would currently only lead to a 3 percent reduction in emissions in the sector by 2050, according to the International Transport Forum (ITF).\n\nThe transport sector would \"miss by a wide margin the reduction needed to keep climate change in check,\" the ITF warned in May.\n\nTo meet the Paris Agreement's net-zero target by 2050, transport-related CO2 emissions would need to fall by at least 3 percent annually until 2030, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned.\n\nThe activists' measures are not supported by a majority of Germany's population, sometimes even provoking violent reactions. Earlier this week, a truck driver drove into an activist. Although no one was injured, the driver could now lose his license.\n\nOn Thursday, the group already blocked two major airports in the middle of the summer vacation season, preventing flights from taking off or landing for hours. With this, the activists were \"doing massive damage to the cause of climate protection,\" Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck said.\n\nThis form of protest is not right, the minister told the German news agency dpa. \"If you really want to stand up for climate protection, you have to take social acceptance into account,\" he said. ■",

We get that the Biden team doesn't care about that, as they race pell-mell ahead with their agenda.\n\nBut it gets worse, as Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) point out. While the Biden team is pushing for this radical agenda that would limit and harm the U.S., Kerry gave China a pass by locking them into the status of a \"developing country\" according to the Paris Agreement, which Kerry helped to negotiate.\n\n“At the time the Paris Agreement was signed, China was the world’s second largest economy, and had been so for many years. Nevertheless, the treaty you negotiated and agreed to locked into place China’s status as a developing country. That was as absurd then as it is now,” the senators wrote. [....]\n\n“China is bent on global domination. It is the world’s second largest economy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is America’s chief economic and geopolitical rival. It exploits forced labor. It manipulates global markets. It steals our technology. It is building hypersonic missiles and a blue-water navy,” the senators wrote. “It should not get special treatment in international climate agreements. There should be no more free rides for China. That should be non-negotiable.”\n\nBut it's the Biden team, where giving China a pass seems to be baked in, so they're building all the coal plants they can. And they're using them to help build all the green energy stuff that the Biden team wants to shove down our throats.\n\nChina is acting within, and taking advantage of, the international framework you helped create—the Paris Agreement. The Chinese coal plants to which you object now power mines and refineries producing critical minerals. They drive factories building solar panels, wind turbines, and electric batteries and cars that the Biden Administration wants to force Americans to buy.\n\nSo it's a double win for China, courtesy of the Biden administration. Once again, bad Democratic policy hurting the United States and being hypocritical.\n",

        "content": "Scotland proposing nationwide “20-minute neighborhoods” where citizens are limited how far they can travel from home in order to save Earth from global warming \n\n\nAre you ready for your government to tell you that you can only travel a 20-minute radius from home because it’s part of saving the planet from global warming? Scotland’s plan to implement “20-minute neighborhoods” nationwide is almost ready to launch, and have no doubts, it’s just another fancy name for climate lockdowns. No, this is not about the pandemic. This is about the governments of the world attempting to steal more freedoms and rights from their citizens, and if you believe you can save the world by staying near your home and neighborhood, then you most definitely are completely brainwashed by the crooked “system.”\n\n\nThe fake “war on carbon” includes restrictive 20-minute “neighborhoods” monitored by the tyrannical Scottish government and the United Nations\n\nIt’s documented already. The Scottish government is prepared for climate lockdowns, where their citizens may never leave their homes again, except to visit the city park (think prison ‘yard’) or the nearby convenient store, then return immediately to house arrest. Every citizen will be treated like a hard criminal, and actually really become one, if the new mandates are broken.\n\nThis is all documented under the United Nations’ “Sustainable Development Goals” umbrella policy. That’s because the “Climate Emergency Response Group” is on the scene, ready to save planet earth from the evil car users and restore the temperature back to whatever it was at before cars were invented (the same).\n\nGet ready to “decarbonize” your energy and land use, while surrendering all of your “natural assets” in ways that benefit the “communities” (big government). That’s right, the Scottish government is planning “future places” where people can walk around or drive a few miles to escape their home prisons. This is also called “local living” and “green space” under the UN goal’s documented “National Planning Framework.”\n\n“National Spatial Strategy” spells out “liveable places” and “productive places” meaning work from home and never leave, except for government-supervised local movements\n\nScotland is just a litmus test for the rest of the world. Have no doubts that once this is implemented and the populace succumbs, it will become a law of the New World Order, run by NATO police and the globalists, to keep the whole world on climate lockdown. This is not a Marvel movie where a few superheroes must save the planet from the sun’s heat bursting all of the humans into flames next month. This is reality, even though the earth is in a slow cooling phase that won’t affect humans for about a million more years. That’s why you should follow the science, not the rogue governments and their insane mandates, if you want to survive this.\n\nScotland’s Climate Change Plan is focused on achieving “net zero emissions by 2045,” meaning their economy will be completely wrecked, the citizens all starving to death, zero employment outside of working from home off a phone or computer, and total government tyranny. The “need to travel” will be reduced by 20%, periodically, until no person shall leave their home ever again, for anything, in order to save earth from global burning.\n\nNo person in Scotland will be allowed to travel more than 20 minutes from their home, and just how soon until even that is reduced to 10, 5, 1, then zero? It’s like when the governments said everyone would have to wear Covid masks for just a couple weeks, to flatten out the curve, then we would all go back to normal. Remember that? How did that work out?",

His actions violated the sanctions against Russia.\n\nExpressing deep remorse, Charles McGonigal pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for the purpose of money laundering.\n\nAccording to testimony before Judge Jennifer H. Rearden, Mr. McGonigal committed his violation of the IEEPA during the spring and fall of 2021, when he accepted over $17,000 to assist Russian energy mogul Oleg Deripaska by gathering negative information about one of Deripaska’s competitors.\n\nSentencing is set Dec. 14 for Mr. McGonigal, 55, who could spend up to five years in prison.\n\n“After his tenure as a high-level FBI official who supervised and participated in investigations of Russian oligarchs, Charles McGonigal has now admitted that he agreed to evade U.S. sanctions by providing services to one of those oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska,“ U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, according to the press release. ”This Office will continue to hold to account those who violate U.S. sanctions for their own financial benefit.”\n\nMr. Williams lauded the exceptional performance of the FBI New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division as well as the assistance provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the New York City Police Department.\n\nThe Former Agent’s PositionFrom 2016 to 2018, Mr. McGonigal oversaw the FBI’s counterintelligence operations in New York as special agent in charge. He directed probes of Russian oligarchs such as Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, Washington banned nearly two dozen Russian billionaires and government officials in response to the now-debunked allegations of collusion between then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. Among those targeted was Mr. Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminum firm Rusal.\n\nMr. Deripaska’s sanctions were upheld by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the court found evidence he had acted as an agent for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMr. McGonigal, who wept as he spoke about his crime, said Mr. Deripaska had sent him at least $17,000 via a bank in Cypress and a firm in New Jersey before depositing the money into his bank account.\n\nIn January 2023, authorities alleged that Mr. McGonigal had received undisclosed payments from Mr. Deripaska in exchange for investigating a rival oligarch and unsuccessfully pushing to lift U.S. sanctions on the Russian billionaire.\n\nAccording to a news release issued by the Department of Justice on Jan. 23, it was alleged that Mr. McGonigal, on behalf of Mr. Deripaska, “fraudulently used a U.S. entity to obscure their activity in violation of U.S. sanctions.”\n\nConnection to TrumpMr. McGonigal joined the FBI in 1996 and worked on Russian foreign counterintelligence and organized crime before taking part in probes into the crash of TWA Flight 800, the 1998 terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.\n\nIn 2016, he was promoted to head of the FBI’s New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division.\n\nThe DOJ was able to monitor Mr. Page’s communications because of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant issued during President Trump’s 2016 campaign. Former Department of Justice assertions that Mr. Page was “collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government” and had been the target of Russian intelligence recruitment efforts have since been debunked.\n\nMr. Page has always denied any collusion with the Russian government and has never been indicted in the Trump campaign probes.",

Ukraine’s leaders say revenues from Russia’s energy exports are financing Moscow’s destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.\n\nThat won’t be easy to do. The EU’s 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.\n\nGermany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shut-off and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU’s executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year’s end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.\n\nGerman Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that “an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.”\n\nDespite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million a day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals. Industry officials say in many cases natural gas would be impossible to replace in the short run.\n\nAnalysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices that would hit consumers who are already facing record EU inflation of 7.5%.",

These units are the first of their kind in operation in New Jersey.\n\nEach CarbinX unit is about the size of two residential refrigerators and connects to NJNG’s HVAC system, where it captures carbon emissions from the building that otherwise would be emitted as flue exhaust. The units also improve the overall efficiency of the facility’s water heater by converting waste heat to heated water – thus, decreasing water heater usage, reducing emissions and lowering energy costs.\n\n“Innovation is critical to achieving our climate and emissions reduction goals in a way that is affordable, reliable and achievable,” said Patrick Migliaccio, senior vice president and chief operating officer at New Jersey Natural Gas. “The carbon capture units installed at our Wall headquarters are part of NJNG’s broader decarbonization strategy to reduce emissions from our operations and support New Jersey’s climate objectives in a way that is easy to adopt.”\n\nDeveloped by Canada-based CleanO2, CarbinX is a breakthrough technology that converts carbon emissions into a nontoxic solid called pearl ash. Pearl ash can be repurposed for different applications, including commercial products such as soaps and detergents and durable building materials.\n\nAdditionally, NJNG is engaging with a third party to perform monitoring, data collection and an in-depth evaluation to fully understand the systems’ real-world benefits. This information will enable NJNG to inform customers and state policymakers about the potential of this technology to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.\n\n“Distributed carbon capture is about more than just reducing emissions; it is also about maximizing the efficiency of the energy we use,” Migliaccio added. “As a flue gas economizer, these carbon-capture units can help businesses use less energy and take advantage of benefits offered under the state’s energy-efficiency programs. The installation of units like these is another way for businesses to help lower their carbon footprint. We look forward to learning from this project and identifying future opportunities.”",

France will be the guest country of honor at the China International Fair for Trade in Services 2024 and the seventh China International Import Expo.\n\nOver the past six decades, the two countries have adhered to mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, with economic and trade cooperation becoming increasingly closer, experts noted.\n\n\"China and France eye faster growth in traditional areas including agricultural products, aviation and civilian nuclear power,\" Cong said.\n\nUnder the mechanism \"from French farms to Chinese tables,\" the two countries have reaped fruitful achievements in agricultural products.\n\nAs an important source of China's agricultural and food imports, France is China's top agricultural import market and second-largest agricultural trading partner in the EU.\n\nFor many years, France has been the largest supplier of bottled still and sparkling wines to China. According to the China Association for Imports and Export of Wines and Spirits, China's wine imports in 2022 amounted to about $1.43 billion, with an import volume of 335,300 kiloliters, of which three countries - France, Chile and Italy - accounted for nearly 80 percent.\n\nIn 2022, France's wine exports to China totaled $661.9 million.\n\nIn addition, France was the first Western country to sign an air transportation agreement with China and the first Western country to cooperate with China in civilian nuclear energy, according to new.china.com.\n\n\"The digital economy will become an important area of economic and trade cooperation between China and France. The two sides can launch in-depth collaboration in artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and other fields,\" Cong said.\n\nThe two countries also have extensive room for cooperation in the field of clean energy, and they can jointly develop and promote new-energy technologies to help transform the global energy structure, he noted.\n\nMoreover, cooperation between China and France in the fields of the economy, trade, science and technology has demonstrated the broad prospects and great potential of China-EU cooperation, which has helped to enhance the confidence of both sides in cooperation between China and Europe, Cong said.",

Review of the Evidence \n\n by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:\n\nEight years ago, on 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn recent development, A Netherlands Court on November 17, 2022 found the Kremlin responsible for the alleged attack: two Russians and\n\na separatist Ukrainian” were identified as “guilty of mass murder for their involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17”.\n\nThe media has highlighted the downing of MH17 in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Court ruling is fraudulent, based on fabricated evidence.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\n***\n\nThis background text was prepared in the context of the Kuala Lumpur MH17 Conference entitled MH17: The Quest for Justice, organized by JUST, the PGPF and the CRG in August 2019.\n\nThis comprehensive report provides detailed evidence that Russia was not involved in the downing of MH17.\n\nIt also confirms the insidious role of Ukraine’s intelligence agency.\n\n****\n\nThe underlying objective is to examine the evidence, reveal the truth and uphold the rule of law.\n\nToday, July 29th 2021, our thoughts are with the families of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy.\n\nThe 2019 Conference was dedicated to the memory of the victims.\n\nIt is also a national tragedy for the people of Malaysia. The downing of MH17 with 283 passengers and 15 crew on board, took place barely a few months following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 after departing on March 8, 2014 from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.\n\nIt is worth recalling that immediately after the MH17 plane crash on July 17 2014, prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation, Secretary of State John Kerry and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power pointed their finger at Moscow without a shred of evidence. In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.\n\nAccording to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):\n\n“… the downing of MH17 should be “a wake-up call” to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.” (Telegraph, July 18,2019)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports (July 18, 2014) that “Obama is getting his wish and Brussels is now weighing new sanctions”:\n\nEuropean governments, jolted by the downing of a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people, are contemplating a major expansion of sanctions on Russia as early as next week.\n\nEuropean Union leaders decided in recent days to expand the penalties to a broad new category of people and companies. But the apparent shooting down of a plane carrying more than 200 EU citizens has intensified a desire to act quickly and forcefully, including sanctions against oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.\n\nIn Brussels, some diplomats described the incident as a game-changer. “It would have major consequences if it was certain it came from the rebels— major consequences,” said one official. (WSJ, July 18, 2014)\n\nOn July 22, 2014, The European Union decided to expand its sanctions blacklist against Moscow including Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.\n\nEU foreign ministers decided to “draw up further broad measures including an arms embargo and financial restrictions on Russian businesses, … following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.” (Guardian, July 22, 2019)\n\nMichel Chossudovsky, August 2019, updated July 17, 2020, July 16, 2022",

The Mexican administration has stated its desire to maintain neutrality in the crisis.\n\nNevertheless, Mexico has cast a vote on a number of significant UN resolutions with the United States and other Western nations.\n\nAccording to the sources, the address was scheduled to start Thursday at about noon.\n\nZelenskyy’s address to the lower house of Congress came at the invitation of a congressional friendship group between Mexico and Ukraine, according to the sources. There are other similar groups in the Mexican Congress, including one for Russia.\n\nThe Ukrainian embassy in Mexico did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe German president and the US ambassador to Mexico have been among the diplomatic allies that have sought to persuade the Mexican government to side with Ukraine against Russia.\n\nAttempts to sway public opinion in Mexico over the war in Ukraine have led to some notable spats in Congress.\n\nLast year, the Russian ambassador to Mexico told Mexican lawmakers that Mexico would never take orders from “Uncle Sam”, prompting the US ambassador to urge Mexico to support Ukraine.\n\nLopez Obrador last year proposed a plan to halt the fighting in Ukraine, although Ukrainian officials opposed it, arguing it would be advantageous to Russia.\n\nMexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard met separately with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to discuss the peace plan at the UN General Assembly in September. Nothing has come of the plan so far.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is currently on a Latin American tour, visiting Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.\n\nRead all the Latest News , Trending News , Cricket News , Bollywood News , India News and Entertainment News here.

Michael Rooker seems equally embarrassed as a grizzled FBI agent, but at least Richard Kind and Julie Hagerty bring some laughs as Owen’s strait-laced parents.\n\nSadly, for every halfway decent joke in the movie (there is a good James Bond quip, at least), there is a plethora of overblown, silly set pieces which trade on the kind of surreal “wackiness” at which Adam Sandler, at the peak of his powers, used to excel.\n\nUnfortunately, for “The Out-Laws,” we are a long way from those heady days, and this flaccid comedy makes you feel every one of its 95 minutes.",

That’s just the propaganda that the climate alarmists would like you to believe. But Marxists often use global warming as an excuse to restrict liberties and confiscate property rights.\n\nData that hasn’t been manipulated by climate alarmists shows that this summer hasn’t seen a record heatwave across the U.S. There is no climate crisis, no man-made climate Armageddon, so why keep pushing the narrative? Because it’s a wonderfully self-righteous veneer for greedy, tyrannical, freedom-hating Marxism. Don’t fall for the propaganda, but be vigilant. The most vocal climate alarmists have a hidden — and dangerous — agenda.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration doesn’t promote toxic “green” energy or target gas stoves and gas-powered vehicles to save the planet. These are schemes to make money or make citizens poorer and less independent.\n\nChris Martz of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow’s (CFACT) posted data on June 26 to explain that evidence does not support the “record heat”/global warming claim:\n\nDespite claims from the climate spin doctors that last week's heatwave was “unprecedented,” not one state set a new “all-time” high temperature record… A total of 39 states recorded their “all-time” June high temperature records thirty or more years ago. Of those 39, 31 were set prior to 1960 and 28 prior to 1950. Six states recorded their June “all-time” record highs each in 1934, 1936 and 2012, while five were set each in the years 1919, 1931 and 1994.\n\nThe Desert Southwest has yet to see a heatwave that is as intense as that of late-June 1994. In the historical record, it remains unmatched.\n\nAs someone living in the Desert Southwest, I can add my personal vouch that we’re not experiencing record heat even within my memory. But by ginning up all this climate hysteria, leftists hope to control people’s minds and actions. The woke activists who glue themselves to streets, splash paint over historic monuments, and swear not to have children because of “global warming” are brainwashed lackeys of Marxist elites. Their life goals are all defined by politicians instead of by their jobs, their families, and their friends.\n\nLoving ‘Humanity,’ Hating Humans: Dostoevsky and Leftists’ False ‘Virtue’\n\nAnd if people are afraid, as climate propaganda is meant to make them, they are a great deal easier to control and more likely to agree with the government assuming dictatorial powers. By the way, I don’t believe the propaganda is quite as effective as leftists would like, but fear is certainly their goal. As the insidious and climate fearmongering World Economic Forum (WEF) put it, you will “own nothing, have no privacy” and enjoy it — or else. Forget the facts that increased carbon is beneficial for plants and warming makes ecosystems thrive — Marxists have a dystopia to establish!\n\nNo major climate prediction has come true in over 50 years. The lies are more ridiculous today than they were half a century ago, but they are still dangerous. We might not be facing our ultimate doom from global warming, but we could be looking at a major dystopian push from Western, especially U.S., leadership that will fundamentally transform our lives.",

Andy Barr of Kentucky, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said that investigating the Biden administration and Wall Street’s use of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles will be a major focus of his committee if Republicans gain a majority in the House on Nov. 8, according to The Washington Post. The lawmakers argue that large financial institutions have withheld investment from businesses that they don’t consider to be eco-friendly based on their ESG criteria. (RELATED: Kentucky Officials Demand Proof That State Pension Funds Aren’t Used For Woke Investing)\n\n“My view is that ESG investing is a cancer within our capital markets,” Barr told the Post. “It is a fraud on American investors.”\n\nBarr and other Republicans hope to force SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to answer questions on the agency’s proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require all publicly traded companies to disclose their carbon emissions and climate change risks, the Post reported. The rule could allow climate-focused investors to more easily discern the “climate risks” of certain businesses and pressure them to become more eco-friendly.\n\nRepublican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska introduced a bill in May to combat major investors’ influence and will continue discussing such actions with industry executives, his spokesman told the Post.\n\n“We’ve become the loud noise in their right ear after all the screaming in their left ear,” Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said about GOP efforts to push back against Wall Street firms’ climate-focused investment strategies, according to the Post.\n\nRepublican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and ranking member on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions told the Post that he wants to force BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street executives to testify in front of the financial services committee as the three massive money managers have used their financial influence to push companies to adopt their climate agenda and other political movements.\n\nBlackRock, which manages nearly $8 trillion in assets, has been scrutinized by Republican attorneys general and state treasurers over its alleged failure to place the interests of its investors above the firm’s stance on climate change.\n\nThe Republicans are expected to take back the House in the midterm elections and will hold a majority in the House Financial Services Committee as well as other committees that can be used to probe the SEC, banks and asset managers.\n",

(People's Daily Online/Zhang Wenjie).\n\nChina's modernization and inclusive development have helped 1.4 billion Chinese people, set examples, and shared experiences with other countries, benefiting the world as a whole, said Irina Bokova, former Director-General of UNESCO.\n\nBokova, who is also the Honorary Dean of the School of International Organizations at Beijing Foreign Studies University, visited China several times and voiced her appreciation for China's rapid progress over the last several decades, stating that China's tremendous economic, social, and technological advancements have contributed significantly to the experience of the globe. She also noted that through cooperation mechanisms such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China is fulfilling its obligation to share its inclusive growth with other countries.\n\n\"UNESCO and China have together developed many joint activities, partnerships and initiatives, among my most memorable moments was President Xi Jinping's visit to UNESCO a decade ago,\" Bokova told People's Daily Online during an exclusive interview.\n\nIn 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the headquarters of UNESCO in Paris, laying out his vision of civilization that features diversity, equality and inclusiveness.\n\n\"We need to encourage different civilizations to respect each other and live together in harmony while promoting their exchanges and mutual learning as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human society, and a strong bond for world peace,\" President Xi said.\n\n\"President Xi's speech about diversity is very important, it shows that though we belong to different cultures, we are all members of one shared community,\" said Bokova.\n\nAccording to Bokova, China is fulfilling its responsibility to share its success with the rest of the world by promoting collaboration and inclusive development. For example, China was the first developing country to realize one of the UN Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, making a significant contribution to the global poverty alleviation cause.\n\n\"China's commitment, inclusive development, and strong leadership demonstrate to the world that equality and inclusion in society are attainable. This benefits not only the Chinese people, but also other countries around the world,\" added Bokova.\n\nBokova has also praised China's \"new quality productive forces\". With innovation playing the leading role, new quality productive forces are forces that feature advanced productivity and are free from traditional economic growth modes and productivity development paths. They are defined by high-tech, high efficiency and high quality, and are in line with the new development philosophy.\n\n\"It is a very interesting and innovative concept China is taking. I think it is justified because the world and global economy are entering a new phase, and it is critical to use innovation and technology to encourage young people to use all of the potential of science to achieve equality and social inclusion, as well as to address challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss,\" said Bokova, adding that \"new quality productive forces\" have the potential to reconcile humans with nature while maintaining all of the benefits of technological progress.\n\nPhotos\n\nRelated Stories\n\n- Xi extends festive greetings to teachers\n\n- Xi: Build leading nation in education\n\n- Xi stresses building China into leading country in education\n\n- Beijing cements ties with Madrid, Oslo\n\n- Xi extends Teachers' Day greetings to teachers\n\n- Former Director General of UNESCO extends Teachers’ Day greetings to Chinese educators\n",

Delegates at the event and their governments were reminded that research on issues such as climate-health nexus, carbon removal and green cities across Africa can no longer be pushed to the periphery.\n\nDeputy Director General of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA), Faustin Munyazikwiye, said climate research funding needs the political goodwill of African countries so that they align the research to the specific challenges they want to tackle.\n\n“We can think globally but act locally and find home-grown solutions. We need to establish our funds from our domestic sources before we seek international help,” he said.\n\nHead of Capacity and Field Development at Wellcome Trust, Modi Mwatsama, said African governments need to do a lot of mobilisation for investment in research that is evidence-based and relevant.\n\n“We must encourage our governments to have climate strategies and increase their budgets for research. They also need to work with other stakeholders to make sure the research can help the people they are meant for,” said Ms Mwatsama.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal, Climate and Development, more than 75 per cent of funds earmarked for climate research in Africa go to institutes in the US and Europe.\n\nThe study says there is already a deep funding deficit in Africa, with less than five per cent of the funds allocated to climate research globally focusing on Africa.\n\n“Of the $620 million that financed Africa-related climate research between 1990 and 2020, research institutions based in Europe and the United States received $480 million while the ones in Africa got only $89.15 million,” says the study.\n\nMs Mwatsama said this skewed financing of Africa-related research can only be solved by Africans themselves developing a more active approach to research funding and building a strong financial base for research, adding that, “even as we mainstream the health agenda in the climate arena, we need to build a constituency that can articulate cross-cutting issues such as indoor health, clean water, agriculture and nutrition.”",

        "content": "BIOWARFARE ON AMERICANS: RFK Jr. says CIA was directly involved in funding COVID research for Wuhan lab \n\n by Ethan Huff, Natural News:\n\nThe reason why the Biden regime could not care less about even attempting to punish communist China for covering up the “lab leak” that many believe occurred at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, allowing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to escape, is because doing so would expose the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its bioweapons program.\n\nThese and other statements were made by 2024 presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a recent interview with Fox News‘ Jesse Watters. Kennedy suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is also involved in funding the bioweapons programs from which COVID appears to have originated.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\n“I think the CIA was involved certainly in this research,” Kennedy told Watters and viewers. “They were funding it through USAID. And NIH, I think, in the end gave about $26 million in funding to the Wuhan lab. But USAID, which was functioning as the CIA surrogate, gave over $64 million. The Pentagon also gave a lot of money.”\n\nKennedy would go on in the interview to blast Tony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), for his complicity in unleashing hell on the world that resulted in tens of millions of needless deaths.\n\n“I think he caused a lot of injury,” Kennedy, who wrote an entire book about the subject, said of Fauci. “I think that he particularly, by withholding early treatment from Americans, we racked up the highest death count in the world. We only have 4.2 percent of the globe’s population but we had 16 percent of the COVID deaths in this country and that was from bad policy.”\n\nRFK Jr. says vaccines do, in fact, cause autism\n\nUnlike the United States, many other countries allowed their citizens to access tried-and-true remedies for coronaviruses such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), both of which were maligned or even banned in the U.S. as “fake news.”\n\n“There were countries that did the opposite of what we did that provided ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, other early treatments to their population, and had 1/200th of our death rate,” Kennedy said.\n\nConcerning the subject of vaccines, Kennedy clarified for Watters and viewers his longtime position that poison jabs do, in fact, cause autism – though that does not necessarily mean that he opposes vaccines being legal, just so long as sound science is able to back them.\n\n“I do believe that autism comes from vaccines,” Kennedy revealed. “But I think most of the things people believe about my opinions about vaccines are wrong. I, you know, all I have said about vaccines is we should have good science.”\n\n“We should have the same kind of testing, placebo-controlled trials that we have for every other medication. Vaccines are exempt from pre-licensing placebo-controlled trials. There’s no way that anybody can tell the risk profile of those products or even the relative benefits of those products before they’re mandated, and we should have that kind of testing.”\n\nBe sure to watch the interview with Kennedy below:\n\nOne commenter noted that he agrees with Kennedy in that COVID was “cultivated” and “intentionally released at just the right time, one year before a U.S. presidential election.”\n\n“It was perfect timing for Biden’s campaign to use it against Trump while they were working hard in the background to hide all of Biden’s corruption,” this person added. “I think they are also funding labs in Ukraine as well. That and NATO membership is one of the biggest reasons Russia invaded.”",

        "content": "Mitigating climate change brings economic benefits \n\n Editor's note: Jin Jun is an associate professor at the School of Management, Zhejiang University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.\n\nMitigating climate change fosters a cooperative and symbiotic relationship between carbon neutrality, sustainable economic and social development, which is mainly manifested in the following two aspects.\n\nOn the one hand, actions to mitigate climate change and improve the ecological environment can yield direct and indirect economic benefits for socio-economic development. Green and sustainable development can propel the growth of society, from enterprises and businesses to regions and whole nations.\n\n(1) New innovative entrepreneurial opportunities and job positions emerge in response to the need to slow climate change. Innovative entrepreneurship opportunities and employment positions related to carbon neutrality continue to sprout up. For example, as \"carbon\" becomes a strategic asset, enterprises have a substantial demand for professionals in carbon accounting and management, resulting in a surge of new job positions. Relevant technologies and market applications also attract a multitude of innovators and entrepreneurs.\n\n(2) The industrial revolution is evident during the process of mitigating climate change, as emerging industries rapidly develop and gradually replace existing ones. For instance, the swift development of the new energy industry and its supporting sectors in recent years has driven the development of the energy storage industry. Additionally, new energy vehicles are gradually replacing traditional fuel ones, leading to changes in the competition landscape and core technologies of the automotive industry. The application of digital and intelligent technology aids the manufacturing industry in achieving the goal of green transition and carbon neutrality, contributing to the high-end transformation of industries and enterprises.\n\n(3) Emerging strategic resources become crucial for enterprises to attract investment and financing. Green initiatives have become a resource for enterprises to attract investment and financing. ESG(environment, social and governance) ratings have become a crucial indicator of whether companies can obtain financing and loans. Carbon trading will also bring companies new revenue sources. Resources like sunlight, water, and wind have evolved into crucial resource endowments for enterprises and countries. Countries and regions abundant in these new and crucial strategic resources will witness shifts in their domestic and international influences.\n\n(4) Demonstration of international competitiveness and industry leadership is linked to the capacity for green innovation and the ability to achieve carbon neutrality. These factors influence the proactiveness and competitiveness of various organizations and countries in global business activities and international business affairs, as well as their international image and market reputation. These capabilities have become essential tools and means to address regional crises. Companies like CATL and BYD have become industry leaders in the global new energy market. Chinese enterprises have contributed to the sustainable environmental and social development of regions including Asia, Africa, and Latin America, facilitating their development and growth in these regions. Meanwhile, the implementation of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), for example, demonstrates that the ability to reduce carbon emissions will affect enterprises’ import and export costs and international competitiveness.\n\n(5) Improved quality of life for people is a result of environmental protection and improvement, which reduces the adverse impact of harsh environments on health. This, in turn, lowers the demand for medical resources and elevates the overall quality of life, indirectly accelerating socio-economic development.\n\nOn the other hand, socio-economic development further promotes innovative entrepreneurial activities that mitigate climate change. Market-driven technological applications propel the iterative upgrading of green technologies, thus driving overall technological innovation. When people benefit from improved ecological environments, they become more receptive to related technologies and innovations, thereby propelling the development of related technological innovations and entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, when companies benefit from improvements in the ecological environment, they enhance their competitiveness and innovative capacity, boosting their ability to innovate related technologies and undertake entrepreneurial activities.\n\nTherefore, the improvement of the ecological environment through mitigating climate change and the green and sustainable development of businesses are mutually influential and complementary, often leading to their coordinated development.",

Newsom, this is your summons to even bolder climate leadership.\n\nGinger Osborne, Laguna Beach\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: California stands to benefit from cleaner air, good-paying jobs and reliable energy with offshore wind technology. But policymakers need to pass legislation that locks in investment and resources for offshore wind to ultimately succeed in our state.\n\nCalifornia should start by ensuring a market exists for the clean power that offshore wind will create. To do that, the Legislature should pass AB 1373. This piece of legislation ensures central procurement for offshore wind, meaning the Public Utilities Commission will start requiring utilities and companies servicing Californians’ electrical needs to have a diverse portfolio of clean energy sources — including offshore wind.\n\nLawmakers need to kick-start offshore wind in California, and they can start by passing AB 1373.\n\nDan Jacobson, Elk Grove, Calif.\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: I agree that California should become a leader in building and deploying floating wind turbines. And while we can help this “nascent” technology emerge, we shouldn’t wait for it to mature to deploy offshore wind.\n\nThere are many unsightly oil platforms not far off the coast, particularly in Huntington Beach and Long Beach. These are grounded. We should deploy grounded wind turbines at similar depths and distances.\n\nMurray Zichlinsky, Long Beach",

        "content": "Your Connection to Nature \n\n I grew up in New England, on a bluff overlooking the Connecticut River. We lived in a quiet town with a village green, a local dairy around the corner, and houses lining Main Street that were built in the mid-1700s.\n\nUnlike the deep snows that blanket Vermont in the winter, we lived farther south, in an area known for legendary ice storms. It’s like the weather can’t make up its mind whether to rain or snow, so it rains—then decides to freeze.\n\nWhen I was in high school, we had the mother of all ice storms. The frozen rain had left almost half an inch of ice on everything from roads and rooftops to the tiniest of twigs. The trees, unable to bear the weight of so much ice, lost branches or were ripped from the ground completely. The branches and felled trees blocked roads and pulled down power lines. We huddled in front of our fireplace, making meals on a camp stove for the better part of a week, without power or heat.\n\nThe ice clung stayed for several days. And then one evening, the mercury climbed from below-freezing to 50 degrees in a matter of hours. My dad and I went outdoors to watch the weather change, and because we lived on a hill, we could see what was happening across much of the Connecticut River Valley.\n\nAs the thermometer rapidly rose, the tons of ice began falling from the trees and rooftops with a deafening roar. The broken power lines thawed and then lit up the sky with dangerous blue explosions of electricity.\n\nDad and I watched in wonder as our frozen, ice-caked world thawed. He turned to me and said, “You’ll never forget this night for as long as you live.”\n\nMy dad has been gone now for almost two decades, but that evening, his comment, is how I like to remember him. The awe of Mother Nature was unforgettable. But it was also that my dad, a slide-rule-carrying engineer would fearlessly turn to his then-snotty teen-aged daughter and express his amazement and wonder of the world. That’s what I remember most.*\n\nI choose to remember that evening, that moment in time when I think about my dad because it makes me smile. But it was also a profound moment because my father, who was a deeply religious man, was tacitly acknowledging that our connection with nature is also about our relationship with God or the universe or however you define the divine.\n\nThe point is that when you stop, observe, and admire the incredible operating system that is nature, how can you be anything but in awe? Nature has the ability to turn a tiny seed into a tree or an ear of corn, just by adding air, water, and sunlight. It keeps the oceans just the right amount of salinity to sustain the lives of fish and other aquatic animals. Our planet provides millions of species of plants, animals, and insects everything they need to survive.\n\nAnd yet, we get caught up in our lives and often lose touch with nature for long periods of time. Long enough for critical habitat to be turned into parking lots and for rainforests to be cut down. Long enough for our air to become toxic, and for the Colorado River to run empty before it reaches the ocean.\n\nI don’t pretend to have any answers, except for the baby step of reexamining your relationship with the natural world. Stop and listen to the birds, notice how moss looks like a tiny forest, wonder at the tenacity of those plants that grow through the cracks in the sidewalk, and be in awe at how trees know to leaf out in the spring. Be the person who picks up a plastic bag blowing in the wind or who walks to your destination when possible, or who introduces native plants in your yard.\n\nLike that moment in a melting ice storm, it’s the small moments, realizations, and actions that can help in sustaining our planet. Renewing your connection with nature combined with inspired action, multiplied by the billions of people on the planet can make a difference.",

Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.\n\n\"In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,\" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.\n\nThat's when he followed with: \"And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.\"\n\nPutin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.\n\nMore importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.\n\nDespite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:\n\nTalks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.\n\n\"We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,\" Putin told reporters.\n\nZelensky's advisor, Alexey Arestovich, argued in 2019:— Glenn Diesen (@Glenn_Diesen) April 9, 2024\n\n- Attempting to join NATO will pressure Russia to invade\n\n- \"Our price for joining NATO is a big war with Russia\"\n\n- Predicting the war would start between 2020-22, with remarkable detailshttps://t.co/8iEn5wSUd9 pic.twitter.com/9fmw5X1DYl\n\nInterestingly, Putin had back in May declared Zelensky \"illegitimate\" after Ukraine failed to hold previously scheduled elections. Zelensky's term was set to end May 20, but the government declared no elections until the war is over, citing martial law.",

James Comer (R-KY).\n\nAccording to Comer, his team has been unable to reach the FBI informant who alleged corruption by Biden and his family, after the bureau dodged a subpoena last week demanding a report detailing allegations that he took bribes while vice president.\n\n“Well, unfortunately, we can’t track down the informant. We’re hopeful that the informant is still there,” Comer told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” Comer also said a whistleblower communicating with the committee about the alleged bribery scheme “knows the informant” and is “credible.”\n\nThe People’s Voice had the scoop on the missing whistleblower last week. Watch:\n\nComer told Bartiromo that the Oversight Committee has identified a pattern of intimidation by the Biden White House.\n\n“Nine of the ten people that we’ve identified that have very good knowledge with respect to the Bidens, they’re one of three things: They’re either currently in court; they’re currently in jail; or they’re currently missing,” said Comer.\n\nHe said others “want to come forward” about the first family’s history of influence peddling, but they “fear for their lives.”\n\n“Not only are the Biden lawyers and the Biden White House intimidating them — the media is trying to intimidate and discredit them,” according to Comer, who went on to blast committee Democrats for their actions in the probe.\n\nComer also revealed further details about how the FBI dodged a subpoena demanding details about the corruption case. According to Comer, the whole thing stinks of a high-level cover up.\n\nThe FBI objected to handing over the FD-1023 informant report last week, informing the Oversight panel in a six-page letter that the information was “unverified” and may risk the confidentiality of agency sources.\n\n“All we’re asking the FBI with respect to the form 1023 is, ‘What did you do to investigate this allegation?’ And they sent us back a very patronizing letter basically saying, ‘Just trust us and don’t worry about it,’” Comer said Sunday.\n\n“This is a pattern of behavior by the FBI that would suggest there’s been a cover-up for many years with respect to the Biden influence-peddling.”\n\nAccording to the subpoena, the report on the allegations was “created or modified in June 2020” — the same month that Biden clinched the Democratic presidential nomination — and alleges a “criminal scheme” involving “money for policy decisions.”\n\nThe allegations are the first to have directly implicated Biden rather than his scandal-plagued son, Hunter, who is currently facing congressional and federal investigations into his overseas business dealings in countries including China, Ukraine and Russia.",

I’m really just giving the broad strokes, and giving people a basis upon which they can do further investigation into what is going on if they are so inclined.\n\nIf readers find the coverage boring, they can skip over it. There is a lot of other stuff on this site. I am covering the Ukraine the exact right amount. I am obligated to do this because so few outlets are covering the war with any truth or honesty. In the English language, the pro-Russia perspective is very difficult to find, with most conservatives who are against the war simply saying that they don’t care either way. “I do care and I actively support those fighting against the Washington and Brussels elite” is an important perspective that must be in the public conversation.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nMitch McConnell was right when he said the most important thing happening in the world is the Ukraine conflict. He was right for the wrong reasons, but he was right.\n\nAmerica Last pic.twitter.com/WKAxPgvHTX\n\n— Alex Stein #99 (@alexstein99) May 11, 2022\n\nSomeone is going to win this conflict, and someone is going to lose. The stakes could not be any higher. The future of the entire world now hinges on the outcome of this conflict. This is the single most consequential military conflict in all of human history.\n\nIf Russia loses, the Putin government will collapse, and the US will be able to steamroll the country, break it apart into several pieces. From there, the US will have China isolated, and then eventually break them. This will result in the final establishment of a singular world order run by the Jewish power centers in the United States, Europe, and Israel.\n\nIf the US loses the war, we are looking at a freefall collapse of the Western economic and military order, a rising China, and a reshuffling of the entire order of power on the planet earth.\n\nThe reason I support Russia is that I want the US empire to collapse. The reason I want the US empire to collapse is that I do not believe that the US empire is compatible with freedom in the US, and believe that we can only reestablish freedom in this country when the empire falls.\n\nIf the dollar goes down and the US can no longer export debt to the world through the dollar reserve system, the US government will no longer have the ability to micromanage the lives of American citizens. They will not have the resources (you have to have a lot of excess money to inflict your will on the entire population, which is one reason why people are so much freer in third world countries). We will be free, and we will then be able to return to the natural order in our society, without Jews controlling everything, without trannies, without deadly fake vaccines, without mass immigration, without feminism.\n\nThose are the stakes.",

If Putin is allowed to “take” Ukraine, what is to convince him, then, that “taking” Poland is not equally attainable?\n\nAt this point, I don’t like any of the alternatives. I think limited, conventional warfare is in order, utilizing lots of conventional high-tech weaponry. The war should not be escalated beyond that, even if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons.\n\nIf the Kraken is already released, what choice do we have but to confront it?\n\nDenys Arcuri, Indio\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: Letter writers advocating escalating use of force by the U.S. and NATO in Ukraine illustrate how Euro-centric and frankly white-centric our global views are.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine is horrific and needs to be addressed forcefully by the U.S. and its allies. But why should the U.S. and NATO engage in armed conflict in the latest global tragedy while ignoring or being responsible for much larger humanitarian disasters of the past few decades, which resulted in much higher fatalities?\n\nLike the invasion of Ukraine, these humanitarian disasters unleashed unthinkable death and destruction on innocent people. Unlike the invasion of Ukraine, they took place in nonwhite and non-European locations.\n\nFew Americans advocated for a global power to intercede and put an end to their suffering.\n\nCarl Godlewski, Venice",

What the gas stove ban means for your fave restaurants.”\n\nPeople in my community freaked out over the headline, re-sharing this misleading article many times on social media. Simply put, the truth is this: Our favorite restaurants will be fine, as the city of Los Angeles’ ban on most gas appliances in new construction does not apply to existing buildings or existing Korean BBQ restaurants. Their kitchens do not have to be altered due to this measure.\n\nI talked to people who re-shared the article online who did not understand this simple truth based on your headline and article.\n\nThat said, I appreciated some commentary in the article about the concerns of chefs who are used to cooking with gas and are thinking about opening new restaurants. It is my hope that chefs across L.A. can discover new ways to cook without harmful gas.\n\nThe wok was invented thousands of years ago and used without fossil fuels, and today, we have induction cooking, which I can personally attest is a wonderful way to cook without toxic emissions. We’re all in this together, so let’s act now to deliver a healthier future for generations to come.\n\nJennifer Ho, La Crescenta\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: The California Restaurant Assn. is on the wrong side of history in its opposition to all-electric kitchens. Sadly, this is not the first time restaurant associations have opposed public health and safety measures. In fact, restaurant associations once fought smoke-free laws, with funding from Big Tobacco.\n\nTo protect public health and reduce climate emissions from gas stoves, our kitchens and homes will need to be upgraded from gas to electric. Thankfully, induction cooking is a superior cooking technology that keeps kitchens cooler and safer. For chefs cooking primarily with woks, there are electric woks.\n\nClimate change and the health dangers of gas are not going away. Instead of ignoring the problem or fighting health-protective solutions, our field must innovate to continue to prepare the dishes we love safely for our families and customers — and the planet.\n\nChristopher Galarza, Verona, Pa.\n\nThe writer is a chef and culinary sustainability consultant.",

This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of “cherry-picking” Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a “misleading” story. Being accused of “cherry picking” by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn’t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested “fines and imprisonments” for expressing scepticism about “well supported” science is laughable, if also a tad sinister.\n\nOne of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a ‘straw man’ argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: “Comparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes”. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on ”mind blowing” low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was “outside anything we have seen”. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice “that’s larger than any we have seen” since 1979.\n\nRead more: Reuters Joins BBC in Failed ‘Fact Check’ of Daily Sceptic Arctic Sea Ice Story",

Such an operation could take the form of a faked attack, a staged ‘discovery’ of agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian planning to use such weapons,” officials said, adding that such a “false-flag” attack would “almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution.”\n\nOfficials added that intelligence suggests that Moscow had likely intended to use false-flag operations as justification for its invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nHowever, analysts believe that the narrative is part of the Kremlin’s plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.\n\nYet both the United States and Ukraine maintain that the laboratories seek to prevent bioweapons and pathogens, a project backed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nIn response to Russia’s allegations, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the disinformation being spread by Russia is “total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.”\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence’s report comes as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on March 13 that the Kremlin might use chemical or biological weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, which would amount to a war crime.\n\nThe NATO Secretary General echoed comments by the UK’s Ministry of Defense that Russia could be using the claims to create a false pretext to justify its actions.\n\n“Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies.

Climate change leads to a breakdown of food systems, resulting in loss of rural livelihoods, income, and ecosystems,\" said the Eastern Africa Parliamentary Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in a joint statement issued in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, after attending the fifth general assembly meeting organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n\nThe meeting discussed current legal and policy issues and gaps related to climate action and food systems transformation in the sub-region, as well as opportunities and priority actions, including policy options and financing mechanisms, to advance this crucial agenda in Eastern Africa.\n\nSome 22 million children under the age of 5 years are stunted in eastern Africa, according to FAO. /CFP\n\nSome 22 million children under the age of 5 years are stunted in eastern Africa, according to FAO. /CFP\n\nAdan Haji Yusuf, the chairperson of the alliance, stressed the essential role of parliamentarians in combating hunger and malnutrition. He highlighted that their legislative, budgetary, and oversight responsibilities uniquely position them to elevate the importance of food and nutrition security to the highest levels of the political and legislative agenda.\n\nMoses Wetangula, speaker of the National Assembly of Kenya, said Africa has struggled with poverty and hunger despite having all the necessary agricultural resources and policy instruments. Wetangula questioned why Africa, with its vast arable land, dynamic youth, favorable weather, and abundant water, has not been able to achieve food self-sufficiency and social transformation over an extended period.\n\n\"I urge fellow parliamentarians to shift their attention towards fulfilling the crucial investment requirements for agriculture, as outlined in the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, which stipulates that countries allocate ten percent of their national budget to agriculture,\" he said.\n\nAccording to recent FAO data for 2023, 135 million people in eastern Africa are undernourished, almost half of the 282 million undernourished people in sub-Saharan Africa. Some 22 million children under 5 years old are stunted, and 362 million people, representing 85 percent of the region's population, cannot afford a healthy diet, FAO said.\n\nDavid Phiri, special adviser to FAO assistant director-general and outgoing sub-regional coordinator for Eastern Africa, underlined the pressing concerns of both climate change and food insecurity and malnutrition in the Eastern African region. Phiri said that even though the sub-region hosts less than 25 percent of the African population, it accounts for almost 50 percent of the undernourished people in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHe emphasized that the bidirectional relationship between climate change and agriculture creates an unprecedented challenge for the farming population, noting that extreme weather events, which mainly occur due to climate change, are becoming among the major triggers of such a predicament.\n\nThe Eastern Africa Parliamentary Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, established in April 2019 in Arusha, Tanzania, comprises members of Parliament from Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.\n",

        "content": "Operation Babylift and the Hypocrisy of the International Criminal Court \n\n by Kurt Nimmo, Kurt Nimmo on Geopolitics:\n\nIn the “collective West,” hypocrisy rules the narrative, most recently in regard to the ICC and the “kidnapped” children of Ukraine.\n\nIn America, the scurrilous neocon and warmonger propagandist Max Boot weighed in on the meaningless and unenforcible decision to arrest President Putin. Boot’s argument is delusional, but then neocons thrive on lies and delusions.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nPropaganda, pure and simple. Boot is an accessory to mass murder, having advocated the invasion of Iraq, the slaughter of over a million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country.\n\nThe hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed “Operation Babylift,” ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.\n\nThe Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as “orphans,” although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as “infants” (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.\n\nThe “rescue” of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).\n\nIn 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.\n\n“The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,” The Adoption History Project notes. “The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.”\n\nA statement issued on April 4, 1975, by “professors of ethics and religion,” pointed out that many “of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.”\n\nThe operation was celebrated by the corporate media and “Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,” writes US History Scene.\n\nUncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.\n\nNaturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude “informational” device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.\n\nRead More @ kurtnimmo.substack.com",

He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about.”\n\nWeichert said: “If Putin suspects the West will prop up a formidable anti-Russian resistance in a post-invasion Ukraine, he will risk not only nuclear war but also will threaten to attack US assets in space and the ISS.\n\n“Putin fully understands the concept of asymmetrical warfare.”\n\nHe speculated that Moscow will ramp up its threats in cyberspace and nuclear warfare.\n\nPUTIN'S THREATS\n\nIn December, Weichert warned that Moscow is plotting to launch a Pearl Harbor attack on the US in the cosmos.\n\nThe Pearl Harbor attack of December 1941 left America reeling as Japanese forces bombed the US naval port.\n\nIn his book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, Weichert says that Russian co-orbital satellites, known as space stalkers, have been tailgating US satellites for years.\n\nHe predicts that the stalkers will eventually hit the satellites, sending them crashing into the ground.\n\nWeichert believes Russia is preparing to launch a \"devastating\" attack on American satellites at the time of its own choice.\n\nHe warned that before launching an attack on Washington’s satellites, Moscow would \"engage in a series of escalations” with neighboring nations.\n\nRussia conducted an anti-satellite weapon test (ASAT) in November where it destroyed one of its own satellites that had been in orbit since 1982.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nBlinken branded the test \"dangerous and irresponsible\" as it created a field of 1,500 pieces of debris, forcing the ISS crew to take shelter.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test marked an increase in the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS.\n\nWe pay for your stories!\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?\n\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheSunUS and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSunUS",

The revered founding document, written on four sheets of parchment in 1787, was protected by its display encasement and not damaged, the National Archives said.\n\nPolice arrested Donald Zepeda and Jackson Green on Wednesday afternoon for what the National Archives called an act of vandalism after they dispersed balloons filled with magenta pink tempera paint powder across the display, according to a court filing by a special agent in the archive's inspector general's office. The museum's rotunda was closed for cleaning on Thursday, costing the government $15,780.62, according to the filing in the D.C. Superior Court. It will remain closed on Friday.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed the two men stood by the powder-dusted cases in the museum's grand rotunda with their hands and clothes covered in the pink powder. Paraphrasing the Constitution, they told onlookers they believed everyone on the planet had a right to clean air and a livable climate, and called on U.S. President Joe Biden to declare a climate emergency, shortly before they were detained by museum security staff.\n\nThey were arrested on charges of defacing and destruction of public property under Washington local law, according to the court filing, a crime with a maximum sentence of up to 180 days in prison. It was not clear if they would also face more serious federal charges of destruction of government property. One of the two men told investigators they were part of the Declare Emergency campaign, which says it uses civil resistance techniques to try and force the U.S. government to take emergency action on climate change.\n\nThe campaign did not immediately respond to questions on Thursday, but shared videos of the episode on social media, writing: \"We the people will not stand for corporate greed and climate destruction.\" In recent years, climate activists around the world have targeted revered paintings and other cultural artifacts to draw attention to their cause.\n\nIn 2022, an activist threw cake at Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris. A few months later, two activists splashed the glass case protecting Vincent van Gogh's Fifteen Sunflowers with tomato soup at London's National Gallery, causing minor damage to the frame. Other activists have glued themselves to famous artworks. The National Archives said the rotunda and the display of the Constitution would reopen soon.\n\n\"We take such vandalism very seriously and we will insist that the perpetrators be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" Archivist of the United States Colleen Shogan said in a statement. Neither of the men could immediately be reached for comment and it was not clear if they were represented by lawyers. They are due back in court on March 20th, and meanwhile have been ordered not to return to the National Archives.\n\n",

China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has asserted its intention to reunite it with the mainland, even if force is necessary.\n\nWhile the US does not officially recognise Taiwan as an independent country and adheres to a one-China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 legally binds Washington to “provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character” and maintain the capacity to resist any form of coercion.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has reiterated the US commitment to intervene militarily should China use force against Taiwan.\n\nThe survey also indicated strong support for American arms sales to Taiwan, with over 65 per cent of respondents expressing approval. Approximately 57 per cent believed that the US would use force to assist Taiwan if Beijing attempted to unilaterally change the status quo.\n\nThe findings highlight a notable gap between the overall credibility of the US and the credibility of its security commitment to Taiwan. Analysts emphasise that more people are willing to assign credibility to the US security commitment to Taiwan than to the US overall.\n\nRegarding the question of whether Taiwan and China belong to the same country, about 78 per cent of those polled rejected this idea.\n\nNotably, more than 50 per cent of Kuomintang party members or supporters, who generally favor closer ties with Beijing, also asserted that Taiwan and China are not part of the same country. This suggests a disconnect between the KMT party stance and the beliefs of its support base.\n\nAs Taiwan approaches its presidential election scheduled for January 13, the political landscape is becoming increasingly complex.\n\nThe election is expected to focus on local health and welfare issues, as well as relations with Beijing and the island’s sovereignty.\n\nWith regional tensions rising, the outcome of the election is seen as a potential turning point for the island’s future relations with China and the United States. The winning party will play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of these relationships amidst evolving geopolitical challenges.\n\nWith inputs from agencies",

The idea was proposed via a study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and serves as a collaboration between NOAA and NASA, but has not been put into practice. A NASA spokesperson denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.\n\nFact Check:\n\nA “fresh group of NASA astronauts” who just completed basic training will participate in the first Boeing Starliner test launch in May, according to Space.com. The launch will be a week-long mission, the outlet reported.\n\nIn the Facebook video, an unnamed male claims NASA is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change based on an article from Unilad. The video, which originally stems from TikTok, has garnered over 1,000 views as of writing.\n\nThe claim is false, however. The Unilad article, published on Mar. 1, 2024, makes it clear that injecting ice particles into the atmosphere is only a “proposed solution” and has not been put into practice. The article also indicates the proposal is a collaboration between NASA and NOAA and references a recent piece from the Daily Mail that cites a study conducted by NOAA physicist Josh Schwarz.\n\nAccording to the study, the concept is called intentional stratospheric dehydration and “would involve dispersing small particles (known as ice nuclei) into high altitude regions of the atmosphere that are both very cold and super-saturated in water vapor. These nuclei would increase the formation of ice crystals that otherwise would not have formed.”\n\n“This ‘[ISD]’ strategy would not counteract a large fraction of the forcing from carbon dioxide but may contribute to a portfolio of climate interventions by acting with different time and length scales of impact and risk than other interventions that are already under consideration,” Schwarz and his co-authors wrote in the same study.\n\nLikewise, Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to support the claim. In fact, the opposite is true. Both Lead Stories and USA Today debunked the claim in Mar. 8 and Mar. 15 articles, respectively. (RELATED: No, 80 Percent Of Texas’ ‘Cattle Grazing Land’ Was Not Destroyed By Recent Fires)\n\nAdditionally, the claim is neither referenced on NASA’s website nor its verified social media accounts. NOAA also has not publicly commented on the claim.\n\nNASA Spokesperson Allard Beutel denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.\n\n“This is an unfortunate mischaracterization of a study done by another agency. As this was a study, NASA is not planning to inject ice into the stratosphere,” Beutel said.\n",

It was unclear whether they were talking about the same facility.\n\nAir defences destroyed 18 of 29 inbound missiles and 25 of 28 attack drones, the Ukranian air force said.\n\nThere were almost no details about what had been damaged, but the targeting of critical infrastructure could indicate that Russia is trying to keep up pressure on the energy system after its strikes caused widespread blackouts on March 22.\n\nThe energy ministry said that Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on March 24 after attacks on the energy system.\n\nSeveral explosions rang out in Kyiv in the early hours as air defences destroyed about a dozen missiles over the capital and in its vicinity, according to Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.\n\nThere was only minor damage from the attack, he said.\n\nSmall groups of people huddled for safety underground in a central Kyiv metro station in the early hours, some of them sleeping on camping mats.\n\nMoscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia’s presidential election.\n\nThe wreckage of a downed Kh-55 cruise missile was found in a Kyiv park, officials said.\n\n“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on social media platform X.\n\nPolish AirspacePoland’s armed forces said a Russian cruise missile launched at the region of Lviv had violated Poland’s airspace.\n\n“The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow [Lublin Voivodeship] and stayed there for 39 seconds,” it said on X. “During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems.”\n\nPoland’s army spokesperson, Jacek Goryszewski, told reporters that the missile travelled about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) into Polish airspace before returning to Ukraine.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Russia. Warsaw said it would demand an explanation from Moscow.\n\nPolish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would continue to support Ukraine both militarily and on the humanitarian side.",

The directive includes a ban on gas boilers by 2025. „If this is not an example of a particular kind of ecological madness, or even idiocy, then there are other examples of Brussels’s mad ambitions,” the PiS politician said. The directive would also stipulate that all new buildings must be zero emission by 2030. He believes this is ideological madness, best exemplified by the fact that until the war in Ukraine, gas was the so-called „clean energy source” powering Europe’s largest economy. Brudzinski also pointed out that it is clear who controls Brussels and whose will and interests prevail in EU actions.\n\n„As long as Germany had Nord Stream with Russia, gas was fine. When Nord Stream was stopped, suddenly the Germans realised that gas was fossil energy and they were already saying we should move away from gas. And what should we switch to? Heat pumps. Where will these pumps be manufactured? Well, new factories are already mushrooming along the German-Polish border – in Germany, in fact.”\n\nthe Polish MEP pointed out.\n\n🔴 Tzw.

Meanwhile, throughout the fall, Kyiv has retaken control of formerly occupied territories, most recently recapturing control of Kherson, a major city in the nation's southern region.\n\nConcerns about attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure have grown as winter approaches, and these attacks threaten to leave millions of Ukrainians without power throughout the winter, which could see dangerously low temperatures.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia hit Ukraine with its latest attack on its infrastructure, which Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko described as the \"most massive shelling\" since the war began on February 24, 2022.\n\n\"Today again Russia strikes large-scale missile strikes on energy facilities. This is the most massive shelling of the energy system since the beginning of the war,\" he wrote in a Facebook post. \"This attack can have an impact not only on the energy system of Ukraine, but also on the energy systems of some of our neighbors.\"\n\nGalushchenko said the attack hit Ukraine's generators and electricity transmission system, describing the attack as \"another attempt of terrorist revenge\" in which Russia tried to \"inflict maximum damage on our energy system on the eve of winter.\"\n\nOne Ukrainian neighbor reported outages due to the attack.\n\nMoldovan Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development Andrei Spînu wrote in a Telegram post that the Russian attacks led to power outages across the country. The lines did not suffer damage due to the attack but were disconnected due to a safety measure.\n\n\"As a result of Russia's bombing of the Ukrainian energy system in the last hour, one of the power lines that provide electricity transport for our country was disconnected in automatic mode (automatic load shedding according to frequency). This has led to massive power outages across the country,\" he wrote.\n\nMoldovan authorities restored power for most of its residents later Tuesday, but Spînu warned that Russian attacks against Ukraine could lead to further outages.\n\n\"Russian aggression against Ukraine directly affects our country as well.

Ukraine’s General Staff acknowledged on Monday that Russia “currently is achieving tactical success” after driving a wedge into Kyiv’s defences. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday that troops had “improved the tactical position and dealt a blow to (Ukrainian) manpower” around border villages including Lyptsi and the town of Vovchansk.\n\n“They are shelling the villages, firing on everything they can,” Sergiy Kryvetchenko, deputy head of the military administration in the village of Lyptsi, told AFP. “The KABs (guided aerial bombs) are flying. The artillery is flying. Drones. Everything,” he said.On Friday, Russia began an offensive across its border into the Kharkiv region and later claimed to have taken several villages in the region near the border.\n\nThe situation in the Kharkiv region is “complex and dynamically changing”, with Russian troops mounting assaults in various areas, Ukraine’s General Staff said. Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on social media that over the last day, “more than 30” towns and villages “were struck by enemy artillery and mortar attacks”, wounding at least nine people.\n\nSome areas were also bombed by Russian aircraft, Synegubov added. A total of 5,762 people have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the offensive, the governor said. Over the course of Sunday, Russia “carried out 22 assaults” in five border areas, 14 of which were still ongoing, the General Staff said. The General Staff said fighting was ongoing for the border town of Vovchansk, where Russia was deploying “significant forces”.\n\nnumbering up to five battalions.\n\nVovchansk, which previously had a population of 2,500 but now has only 200-300 residents, suffered “massive shelling” on Sunday that hit houses and wounded seven, said Synegubov.\n\nA 69-year-old man was also wounded in the town of Izyum by detonating ammunition and a woman was injured in a village near the town of Kupiansk.\n\nThe city of Kharkiv itself had not been struck over the last 24 hours, however, he said.\n\nSynegubov said on national television that “the grey zone and the front line are expanding” because Russia is “trying to deliberately stretch it, attacking in small groups in new directions”.\n\nThe DeepState Telegram channel, which is close to the Ukrainian army, wrote that Russia had taken pockets of territory measuring around 100 square kilometres (39 square miles).\n\nRussia “continues to advance to Vovchansk”, the channel said.\n\n“They are gaining foothold on the outskirts for further entry into the town.”\n\nRussia was also advancing towards the border village of Lyptsi and attempting to enter the nearby village of Glyboke, it said.\n\nUkraine was mounting “constant fire”, including from drones, “but unfortunately it does not stop them”.\n\nThe Russian defence ministry said troops had repelled Ukrainian counterattacks near Glyboke.\n\nRybar, a Russian Telegram channel with military links, said Moscow’s offensive led to territorial gains because troops took some villages where Russian soldiers already had a presence and others that were “deserted wastelands”.\n\nAs of Monday morning, there were no “large-scale breakthroughs of the enemy’s defences”, Rybar said.\n\nUkrainian military said Russia was also shelling the Sumy and Chernigiv border regions further west.",

The DOD is reportedly taking steps to notify Congress of the “accounting adjustment.”\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Reuters that the Pentagon made a “major mistake” that could underestimate future needs of NATO allies.\n\n“Our priority should be a Ukrainian victory over [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. Unilaterally altering military aid calculations is an attempt at deception and undermines this goal,” said the senator from Mississippi.\n\nHowever, the accounting confusion may translate into even more supplies to the Kiev government, according to the agency. As of Monday, the US was reportedly down to only $6 billion in Ukraine aid, from the $48 billion approved by Congress in December. Getting more funding approved is difficult at the moment, due to the standoff over the national debt ceiling.\n\nWashington’s efforts to pump Kiev with weapons consist of two tracks. The Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) allows the Pentagon to send materiel from its own stockpiles – to the tune of $21.1 billion so far, in 37 separate packages. The separate Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) has the US government pay the military industry to make new weapons and ammunition, much of which has yet to arrive.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the Pentagon sent a memo to all four service branches the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Marine Corps – on March 31, clarifying how the value of the equipment should be calculated. The anonymous Pentagon official speaking to the agency used the example of 155mm artillery shells, of which more than 1.5 million were sent to Kiev. While each costs about $800 today, the cost over several decades averages out to much less.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly said that its successes on the battlefield heavily depends on the aid from the West. According to Russian military estimates, the US and its allies had delivered over $100 billion worth of weapons and supplies to Ukraine by December 2022.\n\nMoscow has warned Washington that this elevates the risk of direct confrontation. However, the US and NATO have insisted that arming Kiev does not actually make them a party to the conflict.\n",

U.S. authorities have for years sought to bring Snowden back and arrest him on espionage charges.\n\nThe former NSA contractor was granted permanent Russian residency in 2020. At the time, Snowden said he planned to apply for Russian citizenship and wouldn’t renounce his U.S. citizenship. In 2020, a U.S. appeals court found that the program Snowden had exposed was unlawful and said that U.S. officials who had publicly defended it weren’t telling the truth.\n\n“Will Snowden be drafted?” Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the state media outlet RT, wrote in a darkly humorous tone on her Telegram channel. She was referring to last week’s speech from Putin in which the Russian leader said he would partially mobilize his country’s forces amid the Ukraine conflict.\n\n‘I Didn’t Cooperate’Putin, a former KGB official, publicly stated in 2017 that Snowden was wrong to leak intelligence secrets but didn’t believe him to be a traitor to the United States. Since moving to Russia, Snowden rarely makes remarks on Russian domestic affairs and reportedly keeps a low profile.\n\nSnowden in 2019 told news outlets that he was willing to return to the United States if he could be guaranteed a fair trial.\n\n“People look at me now and they think I’m this crazy guy, I’m this extremist or whatever. Some people have a misconception that [I] set out to burn down the NSA,” Snowden also told NPR. “But that’s not what this was about. In many ways, 2013 wasn’t about surveillance at all. What it was about was a violation of the Constitution.”\n\nSince then, he’s amassed more than 5.3 million followers on Twitter. There was no immediate reaction from Snowden on social media or elsewhere after he was granted Russian citizenship.",

        "content": "What Everyone Is Missing About the Putin/Carlson Talk \n\n by Tom Luongo, Tom Luongo:\n\n“The Vorlons say, understanding is a three-edged sword: your side, their side, and the truth”\n\n— John Sheridan, Babylon 5\n\nThe biggest media story of 2024 so far has come and gone. Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.\n\nEveryone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nNow, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call “talking their book.” In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.\n\nSo, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin’s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.\n\nI’ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.\n\nHow many of you thought Putin was “all there” in the Tucker interview?\n\nIf he seemed lucid to you, it’s because Biden is your comparison.\n\nI thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t\n\n— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024\n\nThis was the kindest of the ‘bad takes’ I found on this. But I’m having one of Scott’s “One movie, two screens,” moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than “unhinged.” In fact, he looked as calm as I’ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.\n\nBut this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.\n\nBy contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the “media” on his blog over the weekend.\n\nWhat’s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin’s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their “analysis” focused on steering the conversation to Putin’s ‘false history’ of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThis way that ‘false history’ would dominate everyone’s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.\n\nThen to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a “useful idiot,” and “puppy dog” and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary’s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson’s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.\n\nWe were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.\n\nSo, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.\n\nI know… in other news water is wet and women want more sex when they’re fertile.",

False Flag Nuclear Attack in Ukraine to Maliciously Accuse Russia\n\n\nKhazarian Terrorist Group Executing Nuclear Terror Operation in Ukraine…\nAGAIN!\n\n“Looking back in history, it must be admitted that these lands are the ancient ancestral lands of the Jewish Khazaria, that is Israel, captured by Kiev’s Rus’ (the ancient state of Russia with the capital in Kiev) in the tenth century. The Slavs are temporary guests on these lands and are subject to eviction. We will return this territory, and build the Great Khazaria – the Jewish state –on these fertile lands the same way as, 50 years ago, we created Israel, squeezing the Palestinians out. Israelis will partially relocate here, and we will drive the Slavic cattle out far to the north, beyond Moscow. There will be a small Northern Territory, a reservation with a compact population — a reservation, like Indian reservations in America.”\n\n— Quote from Menachem Mendel Schneerson, American Orthodox rabbi and foremost leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement\n\nThe preceding quote, uttered by the most revered and powerful leader of the modern Chabad Movement within Judaism, tells the whole story.\n\nThe Ukraine War was actually started by the Zio-Anglo-American Axis to fulfill the main prophecy implied by Schneerson’s series of apocalyptic statements.\n\nWith this critical understanding, it ought to be much easier to comprehend that the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster was stealthily executed as a nuclear terrorist attack … … … and by all the usual Khazarian suspects.\n1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster:\nAn Apocalyptic Terrorist Act of Epic Proportions\n\nThe previous link contains Internet pathways to all of the conclusive scientific evidence necessary which proves that the Chernobyl nuclear disaster was carried out as a covert terror attack by the Western Powers against Russia.\n\nFor anyone who still has any doubt about this revised history, the following exposé clearly spells out the true purpose and perpetrators of that egregious crime against humanity committed at Russia’s Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986.\nChernobyl was a terrorist attack.\nNow, fast forward to 2022.\n\nWhat the whole world is now witnessing in Ukraine today — in the fog of that meticulously engineered war — is yet another scheme to carry out a nuclear terror event in order to fulfill the odious predictions of rogue rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.  It could even be posited that the Ukraine War was purposefully provoked to set the stage for a long-planned and rapidly evolving nuclear terror event.  As follows:\nUS-UK-UA-IL-NATO Terror Group Coordinating Attacks\non Largest Nuclear Power Plant in Europe (Video)\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and among the 10 largest in the world\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station\n\nEvery day that goes by, the Khazarian nuclear terrorist group gets closer and closer to deliberately triggering the greatest nuclear catastrophe of the Third Millennium at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, as a prelude to starting World War III.\n\nThere are obviously several objectives to be accomplished by triggering such a “Nuclear Armageddon”.  Not only do the Khazarian perpetrators intend to force the Ukrainians off  and far away from their ancestral lands, especially the Russian speakers, they also want to establish the “New Israel” there as articulated by Schneerson.\n\nHowever, there is also a major strategic move, along with various tactical maneuvers, that are being made here (at Zaporizhzhia) toward the purposeful escalation of the Ukraine War into the hot phase of World War III where “hot phase” also means nuclear.",

THAAD and PAC-3 refers to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system and the interceptors for Patriot missile systems.\n\n“Especially when you see missiles hitting hospitals and situations like that, and train stations in Ukraine,” Taiclet said in explaining the demand, adding that governments were now thinking “that it’s worthwhile to have an effective missile defense capacity in your country.”\n\nLockheed said its quarterly revenue fell while quarterly profits dropped 5.7 percent as supply chain woes triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic were compounded by inflation pressure.\n\nThe company reaffirmed its full-year revenue outlook of about $66 billion, which is in line with analysts estimates.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden’s record peacetime national defense budget request of $813 billion was unveiled in March as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has spurred demand for more military spending globally.\n\nThe pandemic crippled many aerospace companies’ ability to procure as well as supply parts needed to produce products, creating shortages, reducing inventories and hammering profits amid a period of rising inflation. Lockheed’s dual-use suppliers that cater to both commercial aviation and defense markets have also been impacted. Taiclet said inflation had hurt the company’s performance.\n\n“The result should bring a focus to defense supply chain concerns, which may be evident elsewhere this quarter as well, though there did not seem to be major issues. In addition, management did not change 2022 guidance and with defense budget support and the war in Ukraine” raising defense spending appetites, temporary challenges could be limited, JP Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note.\n\nShares in Lockheed were down $5.33, or 1.1 percent, at $462.21 at midday.\n\nLockheed’s Aeronautics unit, its biggest, which makes F-35 fighter jets saw its revenue rise 2 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago, but profits fell by 2 percent to $697 million.\n\nLockheed reported 26 F-35 jet deliveries in the quarter compared with 17 a year earlier. Taiclet said Lockheed was working to increase F-35 sales for 2023.\n\nNet earnings fell to $1.73 billion, or $6.44 per share, in the first quarter ended March 27 from $1.84 billion, or $6.56 per share, a year earlier.\n\nNet sales fell about 8 percent to $14.96 billion in the quarter.\n\nDuring the quarter Lockheed abandoned its proposed $4.4 billion purchase of rocket engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc after antitrust regulators sued to block the deal.",

Secretary-General, those working for real Climate Action are “on the right side of history” since the battle to stop global warming constitutes the “fight of our lives.”\n\nGuterres’ bombast has been heating up much faster than the environment.\n\nJust this month, Guterres said that humanity must urgently find solutions to climate change because it “has opened the gates of hell.”\n\n“Horrendous heat is having horrendous effects,” Guterres warned in his opening remarks at the U.N. Climate Ambition Summit in New York. “Distraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods; sweltering temperatures spawning disease; and thousands fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.”\n\nThis summer, he said that “the era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived” (emphasis added).\n\nHe also claimed that the “dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,” adding that the “climate breakdown has begun.”\n\nGuterres has placed the blame for the climate crisis on “our fossil fuel addiction,” insisting that “climate is imploding faster than we can cope.”\n\nWhile wild hyperbole and theatrical rhetoric may work in advertising, one cannot help but wonder whether they do not diminish the seriousness of Mr. Guterres’ case and indeed of his office.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",
